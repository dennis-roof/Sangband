# Store owners
#  name, purse, max greed, min greed, haggle_per, tolerance, race 
#
# Purse - limited purses are vital in a game without time limits.
# Max greed - should never be greater than 195, or the initial offer code
#      gets confused, and it's harder to haggle successfully.  Should not
#     be much lower than 160, or initial offers must be closer to final
#     item price than what players are used to.
# Min greed - normally 110, less for downmarket shopkeepers, more for
#      upscale ones.
# Haggle_per controls the way the shopkeeper haggles.  Lower numbers make
#      for shopkeepers that expect the player to concede as little as
#      possible in negotiations.  They have high patience for skinflint
#      offers, but it takes long haggling to knock them down to their final
#      price.  Values of about 12 are average.
# Tolerance determines how many insults a shopkeeper will take before
#      throwing the character out of the store, and also affects haggling
#      text.

# There are some items that are rare by deliberate policy, including

#
# You may insert new items.  Be careful, though:  The code that generates 
# stock in stores tries hard to make the items you request.  This may leave
