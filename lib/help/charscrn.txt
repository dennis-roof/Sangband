
====== The character screen (in detail) ======

     The character information display allows you to review attributes, change
names, and save character dumps to file.  The save character to file command
saves the character screen, character background, inventory and equipment, skill
levels, and the contents of the home.

     This interface has four modes, which you may cycle through by typing 'h'.


--- Main character screen ---

First Row:
- Name, title, gender, and race

- Age : in years
- Height : in feet and inches or centimeters
- Weight : in pounds or kilograms
- Either social class (affects starting gold) or your greatest victory.

- Your base (undrained) vital statistics (stats) and sometimes their drained
values

Second row:
- Maximum hitpoints
- Current hitpoints
- Blows/Round : the number of blows you get per turn in hand-to-hand combat
- Hit Rate: the recent percentage of blows that hit monsters.
- Average Damage: the average damage you've done recently.

- Power : affects hitpoints and some other things
- Score : how well you are doing in the game.  Always starts at zero.
- Unspent experience : the experience you've earned that you haven't yet spent
  on advancing skills
- Gold : money on hand (in gold pieces)

  depth

     Descriptions of abilities go from awful -> very bad -> bad -> poor -> iffy
-> fair -> good -> very good -> excellent -> superb -> heroic -> legendary.
They improve as the abilities themselves do, but may decrease as you rise in
power or descend into the dungeon.  A given disarming skill is much more
impressive at 500' than at 3000'.


--- History display ---

     This is like the main display, except that the list of abilities is
replaced with a character history.


--- Attributes screen ---

     Lists most of the non-combat attributes that equipment may posses.  Shows
only known or obvious properties.

Vital Statistics:
     In the top-center of this display are listed the internal values (the
permanent ones you have before any modifications) for your stats, any
adjustments through equipment items, any through character race, skills, and
conditions, the adjusted stats, and their drained values (if different).
     Modifiers to stats are light green if the object does not also sustain that
stat and green if it does.  If the object sustains a stat without affecting it,
a green 's' is displayed.
