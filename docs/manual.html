     Sangband is a complex, single-player dungeon adventure game in which you,   
the player, control a character in the Pits of Angband.  During the course of    
your adventures, you may learn long-forgotten secrets, collect wondrous objects, 
and battle terrible foes.  Perhaps, if you are very skilled, you may even defeat 
the Dread Enemy himself:  Morgoth, Lord of Darkness.                             

     But only if you are very skilled indeed.                                    

     Sangband is a variant of Angband, which is a variant of Moria, which is a   
descendant of Rogue.  Its primary inspiration is the works of J. R. R. Tolkien,  
among the greatest wordsmiths of the English language.  You will also notice     
some Dungeons and Dragons conventions, ancient and religious mythology, and the  
fables and lore of the European Middle Ages.

<H1>Overview of the Game</H1>


     This section briefly describes creating a character, playing your first     
game, and the most important information displays.  To learn more about these    
things, consult the sections on your character and on interfaces.                



<H2><A NAME="1.1X">Loading and Creating Characters</A></H2><A HREF="manual.html#1.">(return)</A>

<b>Automatic and manual loading:</b>                                                    
     The game will automatically load any savefile named "player", or any        
specified on the command line.  If it can find the file "lib/save/global.svg",   
it will load the savefile of your last living character.                         

     If none of these methods works, the game will show a savefile management    
screen.  Using this interface, you can start a new character or load any         
available savefile.                                                              

<b>Loading or birth:</b>                                                                
     If the savefile loaded contains a living character, you may begin the game  
where you left off or choose another character by typing 'C'.  If the character  
in the loaded savefile is slain, or no (valid) savefile was loaded, or you asked 
to play a new game, you go to the character creation display.                    

<b>Creating new characters:</b>                                                         
     You first choose a gender:  Males weigh slightly more than females, but     
this is not very important.                                                      
     You then choose a race.  This has a major effect on almost all character    
abilities and special attributes.  See the section on races for more details.    

     You may also set birth options at any time by pressing '='.  Active options 
are displayed on screen.                                                         

<b>Rolling up:</b>                                                                      
     If you set the "Allow specification of minimal stats" option, you choose    
the minimum acceptable vital statistics (stats) for your character.  Be careful  
not to ask for too much.  You enter stats as numbers:  16, 17, 18, 18/10, 18/20, 
and so on.                                                                       

     Once you have done this, you are presented with another display showing     
more information about your character.  You also see this display whenever you   
press 'C'.  Reroll by pressing "r", or build up stats using points, until        
satisfied.                                                                       

     You then give your character a name and begin play.                         



<H2><A NAME="1.2X">Game Tutorial:  The Novice's Guide</A></H2><A HREF="manual.html#1.">(return)</A>

     When you begin the game, you start out in a town with stores happy to sell  
you whatever they stock and you can afford.  Visit the stores and stop by your   
very own home (the symbol '8'), where you can safely stash all sorts of useful   
gear for later use.                                                              

     Look at the left side of the screen, where all the most important info      
about you is displayed.  Reading from the top, you'll see your name, present     
title, unspent experience, and money on hand.  Your race (almost) never changes, 
but you can gain more experience points by killing monsters and more gold by     
selling the loot they drop.                                                      
     Below these are the six vital statistics:  Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom,  
Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma.  Near the bottom, you will see your       
armor class, hit points, and (if you learn magic) your spell points.  Armor      
class shields you from direct damage.  Hitpoints are your life wrapped up in a   
number, so run from anything that drops them too low, too fast.                  

     Get familiar with some of the commands you have available to you, either by 
reading the help, or by experimenting, whichever you prefer.  If you mistype,    
the game will offer to bring up a list of commands.                              

     Okay, time to get playing!  Type '$', and the skills screen appears.  You   
have earned just enough experience to choose some basic skills; it is a smart    
idea to do this before entering the dungeon.  The best choice for a new player   
is either throwing or slings.                                                    
     Pick up an inexpensive weapon (Weapon Smith), either some throwable flasks  
of oil (General Store) or a sling and some shots (Weapon Smith), some light      
armor (Armory, General Store), and - if you can afford them - one or two phase   
door scrolls and potions of cure light wounds (Temple, Alchemy Shop).  Once      
you've earned a little money, invest in a lantern and a shovel or pickaxe.  Now, 
'w'ear a torch, your armor, and your weapon.                                     
     See that down staircase '>'?  It's the entrance to the deadly, lucrative    
dungeon.  Head down (Once on top of the staircase, type '>').                    
     Once you do that, you will find yourself in a dungeon of rooms and          
corridors.  Since you have already wielded a light source, you can see, even if  
you are not in a magically lit room.  Go off and explore the dungeon.  When your 
light runs out, re'F'uel it.  When you get hungry, 'E'at some of the food your   
character started out with.                                                      
     When you meet your first monster, pepper it with sling shots (press 'f' to  
fire) or throw flasks of oil (press 'v' to throw) until it reaches you, and hit  
it with your weapon (move into it) until it's dead.  If your HPs drop too low,   
quaff a potion of cure light wounds, read a scroll of phase door, or run away.   
     When you get enough money and objects to sell, go back up to the town.  If  
you have questions, the '?' key is there to help.                                

Have fun!

<H3>The title screen</H3>
     When you start up the game, a title screen appears, bearing the game logo,  
a dragon image, and some credits.  Also on this screen are the three most        
important Sangband resources:                                                    
     The Sangband home page at "http://www.runegold.org/sangband/" contains the  
current source and executables, special files, helpful comments, hints, and      
links, and the latest Sangband news.                                             
     Sangband changes maintainers every so often.  The current one is Leon       
Marrick.  If you want to send him comments, or make sure your bug report gets    
heard, use the email shown on the website.                                       
     The Angband Forum is at "http://angband.oook.cz/forum/"; it's filled with   
helpful folks.  If you want to talk about Sangband or ask for help, there's the  
place to go.                                                                     


<H3>The main screen</H3>
     Once you clear the character display, you find yourself looking at the main 
screen.  This is divided into four parts:                                        

1)   The message line is located at the top of the screen; here all sorts of     
messages are shown.  If in the heat of combat you skip past one too many, you    
can display it again by pressing control-P.                                      
2)   The left side of the screen is used to display important information.       
3)   Most of the screen displays your surroundings.  You can take a closer look  
by pressing 'l'ook (or e'x'amine).                                               
4)   The bottom line of the main screen shows various status displays, such as   
your speed, ailments, depth, and so on.                                          

     You play the game in the main screen.  For more details on the things you   
can do, consult the section on commands.                                         


<H3>The character screen  ('C')</H3>
     The character information display you see when first starting the game can  
be recalled by typing 'C'.  Here you can review your attributes, change names,   
and save character dumps to file (which appear in the "lib/user" directory).     


<H3>The skills screen  ('$')</H3>
     When you collect enough experience, you can spend it on skills by typing    
'$' to open up the skills advancement screen.  Press the arrow keys or the       
appropriate letter to navigate the skills and press '+' to increase it.  If you  
make a mistake, you can press '-' to undo the error.  You may also choose to     
reduce a skill you raised at an earlier date with the '-' key, but your          
experience will not be refunded.                                                 


<H3>The help screen  ('?')</H3>
     The online help system is available by typing '?'.  You can also learn more 
about the symbols you see on screen by typing '/', then the symbol you wish to   
learn more about.                                                                


<H3>The options screen  ('=')</H3>
     You can adjust the way the game looks and behaves by typing '=' to enter    
the options screen.                                                              


<H3>The knowledge screen  ('~')</H3>
     Detailed listings of known artifacts, objects, and monsters are available   
through the knowledge menu, which you access by typing '~'.  Here you can also   
review the high score listings, what you have stashed in your home, and see how  
many monsters you've killed and what quests you are assigned.                    


<H3>The death interface</H3>
     If you should die, you will see a tombstone and be able to check out your   
slain character one last time.  Here you can:                                    
- display the character screen and see your possessions,                         
- review the final messages,                                                     
- save information in a character dump,                                          
- see the high score table, and                                                  
- fully identify individual items.                                               




<H1>Your Character</H1>


<H2><A NAME="2.1X">Races</A></H2><A HREF="manual.html#2.">(return)</A>

     There are fourteen different races that you may choose among, representing  
most of the speaking peoples found in Tolkien's books, plus Gnomes and Giants.   
Races differ in abilities, and tend to be better at some skills than at others.  

<b>Human:</b>                                                                           
     A flexible and adaptive race, humans are found all over Middle-Earth, from  
desert Harad to icy Horodwaith.  They have no special adjustments to stats and   
learn all skills at an average rate.  This, combined with their solid hitpoints, 
makes them effective adventurers.  Humans have no infravision.  They probably    
get the best prices in stores, on average.                                       

<b>Elf:</b>                                                                             
     Known as the Elder Race, and as the First-Born, Elves are famed for their   
knowledge and craftsmanship.  They are somewhat lighter, weaker, and less robust 
than humans, but have superior wisdom and intelligence, learn magic more easily, 
and are somewhat better at most basic skills.  They are fond of bows, somewhat   
weak in melee, and have no infravision.  They resist light inherently.           

<b>Hobbit:</b>                                                                          
     Hobbits are shy, retiring folk with enough good sense to share.  They live  
in homes with circular entranceways built partially underground, and are the     
smallest of all the races.  Although they have few hitpoints, they are highly    
resistant to magic and can sometimes endure ailments that would lay other races  
low.  They are fairly poor at melee combat, but good at most other skills.  In   
particular, nobody can match a hobbit slinger or burglar.  Hobbits are stealthy, 
perceptive, and have innate infravision.  They sustain dexterity inherently.     

<b>Gnome:</b>                                                                           
     Gnomes are the pudgy pranksters of the dungeon; if they can kill something  
in a humorous way, so much the better.  They may be small and ugly, but can      
outbargain and outwit just about anyone.  They are among the frailer races, and  
not powerful in combat, but are good at magic, unmatchable with devices, and --  
most importantly -- are immune to paralyzation.  Gnomes are highly intelligent   
and have innate infravision.                                                     

<b>Dwarf:</b>                                                                           
     Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend.  They are strong, 
intelligent, tough, and resistant to magic; although not very good at casting    
spells, they make excellent priests and smiths.  They are better than average at 
melee combat, but don't know the first thing about bows.  Dwarves have good      
innate infravision and -- a major advantage -- can never be blinded.  They do    
have one big drawback, though:  Dwarves are loudmouthed and proud, singing in    
loud voices, arguing with themselves for no good reason, screaming out challenges
at imagined foes.  In other words, dwarves have a miserable stealth.             

<b>Half-Orc:</b>                                                                        
     The bastard offspring of humans and orcs, half-orcs are ugly, strong, and   
have very bad attitudes.  Their magic is a little suspect, as are most of their  
skills, but they know how to fight and can take as much damage as they dish out. 
Half-orcs have innate infravision and, like orcs themselves, resist darkness and 
its effects.                                                                     

<b>Half-Troll:</b>                                                                      
     Half-trolls are built like blocks of granite; no other race can match their 
strength, their hitpoints, or their powers of recovery.  Their combat prowess is 
fearsome, they throw boulders with deadly force, their stomach capacity is       
remarkable, and their skin becomes ever-stronger over time.  Unfortunately, they 
have poor general skills, need to eat a lot, and have a hard time in stores.     
Half-trolls will be bad at anything that requires heavy thinking.  They have     
innate infravision and always have their strength sustained.                     

<b>Dunadan:</b>   (easier to win with -- 20% penalty to score)                          
     Dunedain are a race of hardy men from the West.  This elder race surpasses  
the abilities of other humans in every field and has superior vital statistics.  
Despite these great advantages, they learn just as quickly as other humans do,   
which makes them a great choice for players whose other characters die too       
quickly.  Dunedain always have their constitution sustained.                     

<b>High-Elf:</b>   (easier to win with -- 20% penalty to score)                         
      High-Elves are descended from those among the Elves who heard and answered 
the call from the Valar at the very beginning of time, before the sun and moon   
were made, and lived in the Blessed Realm for long ages before returning to      
mortal lands.  They are masters of all skills, and are agile and intelligent,    
although their wisdom is a little suspect.  No other race is quite as good at    
magic.  Despite these great advantages, they learn just as quickly as other      
elves do, which makes them a great choice for players whose other characters die 
too quickly.  High-elves are able to see the unseen, and have innate resistance  
to light.                                                                        

<b>Dark-elf:</b>                                                                        
     Some elves prefer the darkness to the light, caverns to forests, sorcery    
and necromancy to the magic of nature.  Dark-elves are extremely intelligent,    
make very good magicians, and can even hold their own in melee, but are not      
nearly as good with missile weapons as are other elves.  Some of their other     
skills are also weak.  They do, however, learn forging quickly and well.  Dark-  
elves always have their intelligence sustained.                                  

<b>Giant:</b>                                                                           
     Eight feet tall, nine, even ten feet tall they stand, and thick and broad   
in proportion.  Giants have more hitpoints than any other race and make          
formidable wrestlers.  Their high strength and constitution make them decent     
fighters, especially with clubs and thrown objects, good tunnelers, and they can 
readily learn magic or object-creation.  Unfortunately, all those tales about    
the naivete and clumsiness of giants have a large grain of truth to them.  No    
other race is less perceptive than a giant, and none is more easy to spot.       

<b>Ent:</b>                                                                             
      Ents are tree-like creatures, large, strong and wise.  Their bark-like     
exterior protects them from attacks, but they are vulnerable to fire.  They can  
handle weapons well, but dislike axes; they are clumsy with bows, crossbows, and 
magical devices.  Their harmony with nature makes them natural druids, and they  
are in touch with priestly magics as well.  Ents have no trouble walking through 
forests.                                                                         


<b>Druedain (Woses):</b>                                                                
     The Drúedain are wild men, with squat bodies and limbs.  They are a         
versatile race not unsimilar to humans, though a little less educated and        
friendly.  They make decent fighters, as they are apt with many weapons; they    
also are make excellent druids.  Woses have no trouble walking through forests.  

<b>Beorning:</b>                                                                        
     The beornings are descendants of Beor, and retain his ability to change into
the shape of a bear.  They are excellent with all weapons and make natural       
warriors, but are bad at spellcasting and devices.

     All racial stat adjustments act as modifiers to your maximum internal       
stats.  A Half-Troll, for example, can raise his internal strength to 18/140,    
but his dexterity only to 18/70.

     Higher values mean that the skill is more expensive to raise.               

     For the non-magical combat skills, magical device, perception, stealth, and 
disarming, a higher value also means that improving the skill has a somewhat     
smaller effect on your ability.  Elves, for example, are innately better at      
karate than are dwarves.

     Sangband uses a scoring system.  You get points by defeating unique (named) 
opponents.  The lower your total skills, the higher the score you get for a      
given victory.  Your score never goes down:  Investing in skills after defeating 
an opponent only has an effect on the points you get for future victories.       
     Because there are relatively few limits on skill advancement, you can       
become very strong indeed before you fight opponents.  However, those who buy    
fewer and less expensive skills to build their character get better scores.

<b>Gold:</b>                                                                            
     Gold is amazingly handy, because everything stores sell can be yours with   
enough of the stuff.  Characters start out with an amount of gold determined by  
stats (lower is better, except charisma, where higher is better).  Social class  
greatly influences starting gold (higher is better).                             
      Within the Pits of Angband lies more gold than you will ever find, more    
seams of treasure than you will ever dig, and more monsters carrying loot than   
you will ever kill.                                                              

<b>Hitpoints:</b>                                                                       
     Your hitpoints are your life wrapped up in a number; if they ever drop      
below zero, you die.  Resting will restore hitpoints, but you should always have 
some quicker way to heal yourself on hand.  Your maximum hitpoints depends on    
your overall power and race, plus a constitution bonus (which can be             
considerable).  It also varies according to skill:  Those who have taken the     
Oath of Iron have the most hitpoints, Oath-bound magic-users have the fewest,    
and all other characters fall somewhere in between.                              

<b>Spellpoints:</b>                                                                     
     If you use magic, you will also have spellpoints, or mana.  Your maximum    
mana depends on your magic power skill and your intelligence (if you are using   
sorcery and necromancy) or wisdom (if you are using natural or holy magics).     
Ways to recover mana faster than by resting are rare and greatly desired.        
     Mana goes down if you wear heavy armor, or are in any shape other than your 
normal one.                                                                      

<b>Armor Class:</b>                                                                     
     Armor class (AC) makes you harder to hit in melee, and reduces the damage   
you take from almost all monster blows.  You can raise it by equipping more and  
better armor, by increasing your Dexterity, and by activating various temporary  
effects.  As time passes, you will find this value rising past 100, even to 150  
and above at very high levels.                                                   

<b>Fame and Titles:</b>                                                                 
     As word of your accomplishments spreads, you earn new titles.  Titles       
describe what skills you're especially good at.                                  
     You can also gain fame, especially by fulfilling quests.  The higher your   
fame, the better the rewards you get from the Inn.                               

<b>Luck:</b>                                                                            
     On rare occasions you can become unlucky.  Unlucky characters meet nastier  
monsters and less interesting treasure.  Although there is no way to magically   
restore lost luck, it slowly recovers as you continue to explore the dungeon.    
     If you want to keep careful track of your luck, you can go into options ->  
screen layout -> left panel, and activate the "luck" display.                    


<H3>Vital Statistics</H3>
     You have six primary statistics, or stats.  Each of them has important      
effects, and how you juggle equipment to boost some stats at the expense of      
others can greatly help or hinder your adventuring.  Deep in the dungeon,        
potions exist that can permanently raise your stats.                             

<b>Values for stats:</b>                                                                
     Stats range from 3 to 18/220.  The progression of stats goes from 3 -> 17,  
18, 18/10, 18/20 -> 18/220.  A value of 18/19 is the same as 18/10.              
     The lowest any stat can go is 3, a level that greatly reduces any abilities 
that stat influences.  The lowest "safe" figure for most stats is 7, but you     
can't expect any significant bonuses until the stat reaches 18 or higher.  Once  
you get a stat that high, further increases will greatly enhance your abilities, 
eventually making it possible to slay some truly formidable monsters.  Stats top 
out at 18/220.                                                                   
     Stats depend on your internal stats, the equipment you are wearing, your    
shapechange, and various temporary conditions.                                   

<b>Strength:</b>                                                                        
     Strength is critical to fighting effectively in melee and with missile      
weapons.  Increases in Strength increase damage, allow you to get more blows     
with heavier weapons, and boost the effectiveness of shield bashes.  Strength    
also improves your tunneling ability, allows you to bear more weight without     
being slowed down, and to wield heavier weapons effectively.                     

<b>Intelligence:</b>                                                                    
     Intelligent characters use magic devices, pick locks, and disarm traps more 
effectively.                                                                     
     If you are using sorcery or necromancy, intelligence is your primary stat.  
It controls how many spells you may learn, the amount of mana you have, and your 
spell failure rate.  If you are using holy or natural magics, wisdom controls    
all of these things.                                                             

<b>Wisdom:</b>                                                                          
     Wise characters have a better chance of resisting magical spells cast upon  
them by monsters.  Wisdom is a priest or druid's primary stat.                   

<b>Dexterity:</b>                                                                       
     Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness.  A high dexterity may  
allow you to get multiple blows with lighter weapons, and will significantly     
increase your chances of hitting with any weapon and dodging blows from enemies. 
Dexterity is also useful in picking locks, disarming traps, and protecting       
yourself from some of the thieves that inhabit the dungeon.  It affects your     
rate of recovery from stuns.                                                     

<b>Constitution:</b>                                                                    
     Constitution determines your ability to resist physical damage and disease, 
and your rate of recovery from poison, disease, and cuts.  It makes a great      
difference to the amount of hitpoints you have and the speed at which you        
recover them, and so is a vital stat for any character.                          

<b>Charisma:</b>                                                                        
     Charisma represents a character's ability to influence others.  A character 
with a high charisma will receive better prices from store owners, whereas a     
character with a very low charisma will be robbed blind.                         


<b>Intrinsic Modifiers:</b>                                                             
     Learning any magic realm increases its spell stat by 2.  If you also take   
the Oath associated with that realm, this bonus increases to 4.  Taking the Oath 
of Iron increases the combat stats, and good wrestlers and users of Karate get   
bonuses to strength and dexterity.                                               


<H3>Abilities</H3>
     In addition to your stats, certain basic abilities define your character.   
They depend on race, stats, and skill level, and may be powerfully influenced by 
wielded equipment and temporary conditions.  You can most effectively keep track 
of your abilities by using the Character screen.                                 

<b>Melee Ability:</b>                                                                   
     The higher your melee ability, the more frequently you will hit in hand-to- 
hand combat and the more critical hits you will get.  Your race, dexterity,      
melee weapon or barehanded skill, plusses to Skill on equipped items (except for 
other weapons), and temporary effects are all factored into the skill value      
displayed on your character screen.  This also holds true for missile and        
throwing ability.                                                                

<b>Shooting Ability:</b>                                                                
     The higher your shooting ability, the more frequently you will hit with     
missile weapons and the more critical hits you will get.                         

<b>Throwing Ability:</b>                                                                
     All sorts of things, from flasks of oil, to boulders, to potions and        
mushrooms, can be thrown effectively.  The higher your throwing ability, the     
more frequently you will hit with thrown objects, and the more damage and        
critical hits you will get with special throwing weapons.                        

<b>Saving Throw:</b>                                                                    
     The higher your saving throw, the more likely you are to resist the side    
effects of monster blows and spells, traps, your own magic (when it fails), and  
mental attacks.  Saving throw depends on race, wisdom, and your magic resistance 
skill.                                                                           

<b>Stealth:</b>                                                                         
     The ability to move silently about is very useful.  If your stealth is good 
enough, you can avoid fights, get in the first blow, and fight monsters one at a 
time.  Stealth depends on race, your stealth skill, and equipped objects.        

<b>Disarming:</b>                                                                       
     The higher your disarming ability, the more quickly and safely you can pick 
locks and disarm chests and traps.  Race, your disarming skill, dexterity,       
intelligence, and equipped objects all affect this ability.                      

<b>Magical Devices:</b>                                                                 
     Determines how likely you are to successfully use magical devices and most  
activatable items - dragon scale mail being the exception.  Race, magical device 
skill, intelligence, and equipped objects all affect this ability.  You need a   
lot of skill to handle high-level wands, staffs, rods, rings, and amulets, and   
also a fair amount for most other activatable items.  Confusion, hallucination,  
blindness, stunning, fear, berserk rage, and necro rage all reduce your ability  
to use magical devices.                                                          

<b>Perception:</b>                                                                      
     The better your perception, the more likely it is that you will see traps   
and secret doors automatically or by searching for them.  Perception depends on  
race, perception skill, and equipped objects.                                    
     Note that this ability has no direct relationship to your ability to sense  
objects or hear monsters.                                                        

<b>Infra-vision:</b>                                                                    
     The higher your infravision, the further away you can see warm-blooded      
creatures, even when invisible or not lit.                                       


<H3>Conditions</H3>
     Your character may benefit or suffer from many different conditions.  The   
most important ones are displayed on the bottom row of the main screen.  We      
describe them as they are displayed, from left to right.                         

<b>Hunger:</b>                                                                          
     You need to eat every so often.  If you eat too much, you become bloated    
and slow down.  If you eat too little, you become hungry (no special effects),   
weak (slower recovery), feel faint (pass out every so often), and finally starve 
(take damage every turn).                                                        

<b>Temporary conditions:</b>                                                            
  Paralyzed : You cannot do ANYTHING until the effects wear off.                 
  Wounds    : Instead of recovering battle damage, you take additional damage    
              every turn.                                                        
  Stunning  : Your combat and spellcasting abilities decrease - slightly when    
              stunned, considerably when heavily stunned.  If you are too        
              heavily stunned, you can be knocked out!                           
  Blindness : You cannot see most monsters, it is harder to learn about objects  
              or what's around you, and get only vague information when many     
              things happen.  You often miss monsters, and cannot cast spells    
              or read scrolls.                                                   
  Confusion : You move and attack in random directions, cannot cast spells or    
              read scrolls, and have difficulty using magical devices.           
  Hallucination : You see weird stuff everywhere, cannot target anything, cannot 
              cast spells or read scrolls, and have difficulty using magical     
              devices.                                                           
  Poison    : Instead of recovering battle damage, you take additional damage    
              every turn.                                                        
  Disease   : Similar, but is harder to recover from.                            
  Fear      : You cannot attack monsters in melee, and find it slightly more     
              difficult to use missile weapons, throw things, cast spells, or    
              use magical devices.                                               
  Recall    : You are about to teleport to the surface, or to the deepest level  
              of the dungeon that you have ever visited.                         
  Darkness  : You are standing in darkness and have no light source.  You can    
              only read some scrolls (mostly dealing with escape, light, and     
              darkness) and only priests and necromancers can cast spells.       
			  Without infravision, you will have trouble with many things.       


     There are many other temporary conditions, most of which are explained by   
the objects or spells that cause them.                                           

<b>State:</b>                                                                           
     You can sometimes be in one of several different states.                    

  Rest      : You are resting (doubles the rate at which you recover HPs and     
              mana).                                                             
  Repeat    : You are repeating an action (like tunneling).                      
  Sneaking  : You are sneaking around (greatly improves your stealth, but slows  
              you down)                                                          
  Crossing  : You are traversing rough or difficult terrain                      

<b>Speed:</b>                                                                           
     The faster you are, the less time you take to perform all kinds of actions. 
It is vital not to become too slow.  As you descend into the dungeon, you need   
to find ways to hasten yourself temporarily and permanently.                     
     A speed of +10 is double speed ("fast"), and one of +20 is triple speed     
("very fast").  A speed of -10 is half speed ("slow"), and one of -20 is one     
third speed ("very slow").                                                       
     Permanent speed bonuses add to your base speed.  Temporary effects may      
increase or reduce speed by 10.                                                  

<b>Depth:</b>                                                                           
     How deep in the dungeon you are.  This display may be colored:  Greys       
indicate relative safety, whites normal conditions, yellow-orange-red indicate   
increasing danger or rewards, and violet means that you are on a special level.

     The character information display allows you to review attributes, change   
names, and save character dumps to file.  The save character to file command     
saves the character screen, character background, inventory and equipment, skill 
levels, and the contents of the home.

     Descriptions of abilities go from awful -> very bad -> bad -> poor -> iffy  
-> fair -> good -> very good -> excellent -> superb -> heroic -> legendary.

power or descend into the dungeon.  A given disarming skill is much more         
impressive at 500' than at 3000'.                                                


<H3>History display</H3>
     This is like the main display, except that the list of abilities is         
replaced with a character history.                                               


<H3>Attributes screen</H3>
     Lists most of the non-combat attributes that equipment may posses.  Shows

     In the top-center of this display are listed the internal values (the       
permanent ones you have before any modifications) for your stats, any            
adjustments through equipment items, any through character race, skills, and     
conditions, the adjusted stats, and their drained values (if different).         
     Modifiers to stats are light green if the object does not also sustain that 
stat and green if it does.  If the object sustains a stat without affecting it,  
a green 's' is displayed.

<H2><A NAME="2.4X">Skills</A></H2><A HREF="manual.html#2.">(return)</A>

     You can normally raise as many skills as you have the experience to afford. 
The major exception is that you need to choose between becoming a pure           
spellcaster, a pure burglar, a spellcaster/fighter/burglar, or a pure fighter.   
Any of these, however, can become great at object-creation.                      


<H3>The Price of Skills</H3>
<b>Striking a balance:</b>                                                              
     You should strike a balance between focusing on too few skills (the cost to 
raise skills goes up rapidly with level) and too many (which fritters away your  
hard-earned exp).  Raising too many skills that depend on objects (most kinds of 
combat or forging, say) can also cause real problems with managing your          
inventory; you won't have enough space for everything.                           
     As mentioned before, the fewer times you raise skills to defeat a given     
opponent, the higher your score.                                                 

<b>Minimum experience:</b>                                                              
     The minimum experience required to raise skills goes up with character      
power, but the experience you get from killing monsters increases very rapidly   
as you descend into the dungeon.                                                 

<b>Practice:</b>                                                                        
     The price to raise certain skills goes up if you haven't used that skill    
much.  For example, if you've never used edged weapons, and suddenly raise your  
Swordsmanship skill 20 points, you can expect to pay considerably over the odds. 
This is an excellent reason not to raise a skill too far, too fast.  This only   
applies to skills that directly earn you experience - any of the combat skills,  
burglary, disarming, magic, and magical devices.                                 
     You practice skills whenever you gain experience and whenever you do        
physical damage to a monster.                                                    
     When a skill is more difficult to raise because of lack of practice, the    
skills screen will display its cost first in grey, then in yellow, orange, and   
red.                                                                             

<b>Reduction in cost for similar skills:</b>                                            
     If you raise a skill, the cost to raise any similar skills up to that level 
is reduced.  For example, if you raise Swordsmanship to 30, then also raising    
Jousting to 30 costs 1/2 the exp it would normally.  This reduction also applies 
to the second skill's effect on your score and on character power.  Therefore,   
raising Swordsmanship and Jousting costs a combined total of 18 for all          
purposes.                                                                        


<H3>Oaths</H3>
     The most powerful warrior arts and the most awesome magics require intense  
commitment.  This commitment is represented by Oaths.  Taking an Oath is         
binding; you can never retract it.  You can never take more than one Oath.       

<b>The Oath of Iron:</b>                                                                
     The Oath of Iron is the greatest of commitments; none who refuse to take it 
can learn the most powerful warrior arts.  Inductees can spread their blows out  
among weaker monsters, can handle heavy weapons with ease, have better combat    
stats, get the most bonuses to missile might and shooting speed, the most        
hitpoints, and have access to several very powerful talents.  However, they can  
learn no realm of magic, and their magic devices suffer a 33% penalty.           
     You gain access to the Oath of Iron by raising a combat skill to level 45   
or above.                                                                        

<b>The Magic-users' Oaths:</b>                                                          
     Each realm of magic also has an Oath.  Wizards may take the Oath of         
Sorcery, Priests subscribe to the Covenant of Faith, Druids join Yavanna's       
Fellowship, and Necromancers bind themselves to the Black Mystery.  You gain     
access to the magic-user Oaths by choosing that realm of magic, and then
raising the specialist skill for that realm (wizardry, holy alliance,
etc.) to 20.
     Spellcasters that have taken the Oath associated with their realm cast      
spells at full power, have another +2 bonus to their spell stat, and eventually  
get plenty of mana.  However, they also are worse for their skill in all kinds   
of non-magical combat, have a hard time with heavy armor, and get fewer          
hitpoints.  Spellcasters that haven't taken any special Oath have only a few of  
these limitations, but get 40% less mana, and cast spells at 75% maximum         
strength.                                                                        

<b>Joining the Burglars' Guild:</b>                                                     
     If you have not taken any other Oath, and attain a skill of 20 in           
Burglary, you may join the Burglars' Guild.  This lets you take fullest          
advantage from further increases in Burglary (otherwise the effect of a skill    
above 20 is halved).  Most of the advantages to joining the Guild depend on      
your Burglary skill, but all Brothers and Sisters of the Guild get monster       
awareness bonuses, which make it safer to navigate darkened rooms.  They also    
get a +2 bonus to Dexterity, an increase to critical hit chance when fighting or 
shooting out of a darkened area, and can (if skilled at fighting) attack         
multiple weaker monsters at once.                                                
     The most important disadvantage to joining the Guild is simply that you     
cannot take any other Oath, placing the most powerful magics and warrior         
techniques out of your grasp.  You get slightly fewer hitpoints than a normal    
character.  Also, shopkeepers are more wary of you:  your charisma drops by 2    
(in addition to the penalty for learning how to steal).                          


<H3>List of Skills</H3>
<b>Swordsmanship   (cost - 12):</b>                                                     
     Determines hit chance and critical hits with swords and other bladed        
weapons.  Allows characters to wield heavier weapons without penalty and handle  
two weapons at once more effectively.                                            
     Bladed weapons are relatively light and easy to use.  Many a hero of old    
has chosen them; their battle-blades still exist.  However, most swords do not   
have the raw power that the greater hafted weapons and polearms possess.         
     Swordsmanship reduces the cost of other skills:  Jousting by 1/2, Clubbing  
by 1/4.                                                                          

<b>Clubbing   (cost - 12):</b>                                                          
     Determines hit chance and critical hits with blunt weapons.  Allows         
characters to wield heavier weapons without penalty and handle two weapons at    
once more effectively.                                                           
     Hafted weapons tend to be heavy, sometimes very heavy, but potentially do   
more raw damage than either swords or polearms.  They are also effective against 
monsters that resist edged weapons (swords and polearms).  Critical hits with    
blunt weapons occasionally stun monsters.                                        
     Clubbing reduces the cost of other skills:  Swordsmanship by 1/4, Jousting  
by 1/4.                                                                          

<b>Jousting   (cost - 12):</b>                                                          
     Determines hit chance and critical hits with pole-mounted edged weapons     
(spears, axes, halberds, quarterstaves, etc.).  Allows characters to wield       
heavier weapons without penalty and handle two weapons at once more              
effectively.  Increases any armor bonus that polearms provide (bonus can be up   
to five times normal).                                                           
     The more powerful polearms often require two hands to use, a real           
disadvantage.  However, many polearms grant significant bonuses to armor class,  
and critical hits with polearms directly rob monsters of energy.                 
     Jousting reduces the cost of other skills:  Swordsmanship by 1/2, Clubbing  
by 1/4.                                                                          

<b>Archery - Xbows   (cost - 9):</b>                                                    
<b>Archery - Bows   (cost - 9):</b>                                                     
<b>Archery - Slings   (cost - 7):</b>                                                   
     Determines hit chance, critical hits, and power and number of shots with    
crossbows, bows, and slings.  Crossbows get higher missile multipliers, bows get 
extra shots, and slings get both.  Characters that have taken the Oath of Iron   
get the most bonuses and specialist spellcasters get the fewest.  Slingshot are  
considered blunt weapons, and are therefore a good backup for characters who     
rely on bladed melee weapons.  Arrows and bolts are considered to be edged.      
     Archery - Xbows and Archery - Bows reduce the cost of the other by 1/3rd,   
and of Archery - Slings by 1/6th.                                                
     Archery - Slings reduces the cost of both Archery - Xbows and Archery -     
Bows by 1/6th.                                                                   

<b>Throwing   (cost - 9):</b>                                                           
     Determines hit chance with any thrown object.  Increases the damage and/or  
power of many kinds of thrown potions.  With special throwing weapons,           
determines chance of critical hits and damage multiplier.  This skill can make   
carrying around flasks of oil, mushrooms, or boulders quite handy, and allow you 
to turn potions you wouldn't want to drink and well-balanced weapons into deadly 
missiles.                                                                        

<b>Wrestling   (cost - 12):</b>                                                         
     Affects hit chance and damage when wrestling.  Sufficient increases in this 
skill increase strength and also dexterity, allow you to bash doors and chests   
with greater force, tunnel more rapidly, and recover from stuns more quickly.    
Good wrestlers get an HP bonus of up to 50.                                      
     Wrestling requires that you not wield a weapon (You can carry a shield,     
however).  This combat method doesn't work on non-material beings unless you are 
blessed, and will hurt you if you try it on highly poisonous or acidic           
creatures, elementals, or vortexes, but is fully effective against monsters that 
resist edged and/or blunt weapons.  Wrestling does a lot of damage and sometimes 
allows you to rob monsters of energy by throwing them to the ground.  You need   
to be quite strong to be a truly effective wrestler.                             
     If you are a good enough wrestler, and have taken the Oath of Iron, you can 
turn your skin to stone (65) or go into a berserk fury (80) at will.  Very       
skilled wrestlers who are not wielding a weapon get special immunities:  free    
action at a skill of 86, resist sound and stunning at 92, and resist confusion   
at 98.                                                                           

<b>Karate   (cost - 11):</b>                                                            
     Affects hit chance and damage when using karate.  Sufficient increases in   
this skill increase dexterity and also strength, allow you to dodge better and   
become slightly more stealthy, and recover from stuns more quickly.              
     Karate requires that you not wield a weapon (You can carry a shield,        
however).  This combat method doesn't work on non-material beings unless you are 
blessed, and will hurt you if you try it on highly poisonous or acidic           
creatures, elementals, or vortexes, but is fully effective against monsters that 
resist edged and/or blunt weapons.  Karate does a fair amount of damage and      
often inflicts momentary stunning, confusing, or slowing.  You need to be quite  
dexterous (and also strong) to be a truly effective user of karate.              
     If you are good enough at karate, and have taken the Oath of Iron, you can  
sometimes go into a brief trance-like state (90) in which you are highly         
resistant to damage.  Very skilled karate users who are not wielding a weapon    
get special immunities:  free action at a skill of 86, resist sound and stunning 
at 92, and resist confusion at 98.                                               

<b>Spellcasting   (cost - 16):</b>                                                      
     Determines the level of spells that can be cast and the raw power of most   
spells.                                                                          

<b>Magical power   (cost - 12):</b>                                                     
     Determines the maximum amount of mana you have to spend on magic spells.    
Specialist spellcasters can raise this skill to the maximum, spellcasters that   
have not taken an Oath cannot raise it above level 50, and non-spellcasters      
cannot raise this skill at all.                                                  

<b>Wizardry   (cost - 6):</b>                                                           
     Determines spell failure chance and reliability for wizards.  Allows you to 
learn about base monster mana faster, and even be able to make good guesses      
about current mana (especially for well-known monsters).  Protects against mana  
draining attacks.                                                                
     If you are not a wizard, learning wizardry grants access to a few of the    
spells that wizards use as talents:  detect magic (40), semi-controlled          
teleportation (70), and mana recovery (75).                                      

<b>Holy Alliance   (cost - 6):</b>                                                      
     Determines prayer failure chance and reliability for priests.  Yields       
warnings (above about level 55) of demonic creatures, up to and including real-  
time detection.  Provides a substantial degree of protection from their blows,   
increases critical hit chance*.  Eventually increases intrinsic light range      
(this is the only way to get a light radius of five).  Reduces the damage you    
take from light, and eventually renders you invulnerable to holy orbs.  Controls 
the duration and effectiveness of protection from evil spells.  Improves your    
chance of sensing cursed and blessed items.  You cannot learn both Holy Alliance 
and Blood Dominion.                                                              
     If you are not a priest, learning holy alliance also gives you two special  
talents:  sense evil (30) and restore stats (75).                                

* The extra critical hit chance and protection granted by Holy Alliance, Nature  
Lore, and Blood Dominion is greatest for those who have taken the Oath of Iron,  
middling for those without a magic realm, and relatively low for magic-users.    

<b>Nature Lore   (cost - 6):</b>                                                        
     Determines lore failure chance and reliability for druids, and their        
ability to forecast the weather.  Yields warnings (above about level 55) of      
natural creatures, up to and including full real-time detection.  Provides a     
substantial degree of protection from their blows, increases critical hit        
chance.  Makes you learn about any monster faster.  Improves personal protection 
and hit chance in forested terrain.  Improves your ability to learn about        
mushrooms.                                                                       
     If you are not a druid, learning nature lore also gives you two special     
talents:  detect animals (25) and mend self (50).                                

<b>Blood Dominion   (cost - 6):</b>                                                     
     Determines ritual failure chance and reliability for necromancers.  Yields  
warnings (above about level 55) of undead creatures, up to and including full    
real-time detection.  Provides a substantial degree of protection from their     
blows, increases critical hit chance.  Reduces the damage you take from          
darkness, and makes it much less likely that you will get the Black Breath.  You 
cannot learn both Holy Alliance and Blood Dominion.                              
     If you are not a necromancer, learning blood dominion also gives you two    
special talents:  sense undead (25) and restore experience (85).                 

<b>Magical Device   (cost - 16):</b>                                                    
     Determines success rate with magical devices and all activatable items      
except dragon scale mail, and increases their power when used.  Makes recharging 
less likely to blow up items.  Allows you to learn the true effects of magical   
devices and activatable items more quickly and to automatically sense charges    
(70).                                                                            

<b>Burglary   (cost - 12):</b>                                                          
     Allows you to steal objects from monsters, lock doors, and get highly       
effective sneak attacks against sleeping monsters and backstabs against fleeing  
ones.  Renders you far more silent in all kinds of non-magical combat, and       
allows you to set deadly traps for unwary monsters.  Burglars become worse with  
heavy melee weapons but much better with light ones as their skills improve.  If 
you raise Burglary to the point at which you can steal (level 4), shopkeepers    
start to mistrust you; your Charisma drops by 2.  You must join the Burglars'    
Guild to get the full effect of increasing your skill past 20 (otherwise it is   
halved).                                                                         
     Burglary reduces the cost of other skills:  Disarming by 3/4, Stealth by    
1/3, Dodging by 1/3.                                                             
     Burglary grants three talents:  Detect and Nab objects (40), poison ammo    
(55), and hit and run (70).  It also grants three special abilities:  stealing   
(4), locking doors (7), and trap-setting (10).                                   
                          See the section on burglary.                           

<b>Perception   (cost - 7):</b>                                                         
     This talent improves your ability to find traps and hidden doors.  A        
relatively small investment in it gives you hints on unidentified object quality 
much more often (this is very useful, and a good reason to pay attention to this 
skill early).  It also improves the chance to get full numerical data on the     
power of magical devices and activatable items and to automatically sense        
charges.                                                                         
     Perception biases all sort of sighting and awareness rules in your favour.  
For example, it allows you (above about level 18) to sometimes "hear" unseen     
monsters nearby.  Take this skill high enough, and you will start to get         
precognition messages (which can be extremely helpful for a truly skilled        
character).  Perception can even help you find essences.                         
    Perception grants one talent:  Sense area (55).                              

<b>Stealth   (cost - 6):</b>                                                            
     Decreases the amount of innate noise and also most kinds of directed noise  
you make.  When you are deliberately "sneaking", when your skill is high         
relative to dungeon depth, or when you are moving about in total darkness, the   
effects of this skill are maximized.  Increases the power of various             
camouflaging and concealment magics.  Most importantly, stealth makes it more    
likely that monsters will be generated asleep and reduces the rate at which they 
enter the dungeon.                                                               
     Stealth reduces the cost of Burglary by 1/3rd of its own cost.              
     Stealth grants two talents:  Sneaking (10) and superstealth (75).           

<b>Disarming   (cost - 4):</b>                                                          
     Improves your ability to safely disarm traps and chests and unlock doors.   
The higher you raise it compared to dungeon depth, the more likely that you will 
get guaranteed safe disarming (magic, in contrast, is always slightly chancy),   
and be able to automatically avoid any trap you walk onto unawares.  A skill     
of 100 provides perfect disarming and protection.  With very high skill (or high 
skill relative to current depth), you can sometimes loot traps as you disarm     
them!                                                                            
     Disarming reduces the cost of Burglary by 3/4ths of its own cost.           

<b>Dodging   (cost - 6):</b>                                                            
     Improves ability to retain spellpoints when wearing heavy armor.  Gives     
you a guaranteed armor class even if you are wearing no armor.  Is the most      
important factor in your ability to dodge missiles, both magical and physical,   
and some kinds of traps.  Also gives you protection against melee attacks        
(especially attempts to steal).                                                  
     Other factors can help or hurt your dodging ability and, in extreme cases,  
make the game act as though you had no skill at all.  See the talent "dodging"   
for how to maximize your dodging ability.  Your character screen takes all       
factors into account.                                                            
     Dodging reduces the cost of Burglary by 1/3rd of its own cost.              

<b>Spell resistance   (cost - 4):</b>                                                   
     Increases your saving throw against magical and mental attacks (blinding,   
confusion, paralyzation, etc.).  Attention paid to this skill can save your      
life...                                                                          

<b>Weaponsmithing   (cost - 11):</b>                                                    
     Once you raise it to 15, allows you to forge melee and throwing weapons     
as well as bows and missiles from components found in the dungeon. <i>Note:  you    
also need to be moderately skilled in using the weapon type you are making to    
get good results.</i>                                                                

<b>Armor forging   (cost - 14):</b>                                                     
     With a skill of 15, allows you to forge armor from components found in the  
dungeon.  Armor forging is very powerful, because there are almost no object     
qualities that cannot be had with enough skill, good enough components, and a    
dash of luck.                                                                    

<b>Alchemy   (cost - 6):</b>                                                            
     Allows you to create potions, scrolls, rings and amulets.  You need a skill 
of 10 to create potions and scrolls, and a skill of 35 to create rings and       
amulets.                                                                         
     A relatively high magical infusion or alchemy skill is essential for        
reliably finding essences, especially deep in the dungeon (Perception also helps 
a little).                                                                       

<b>Magical infusion   (cost - 13):</b>                                                  
     Infusion is among the most powerful of skills, because it allows you to use 
magical essences to control the powers that armor, weapons, and missiles get,    
pack essences into potions that explode violently when thrown, and make more     
potions and scrolls using a given number of essences.  You need an infusion      
skill of 10 to infuse forged items.                                              
     A relatively high magical infusion or alchemy skill is essential for

     Infusion grants one talent:  Recharging with essences (30).                 

<b>Shapechange  (cost - 14)</b>                                                         
	Shapechanging allows you to take the form of many different beasts, modifying
your stats, resistances, and more.  Some forms are only available in combination 
with the nature lore or blood dominion skill.  Press ']' to change form.  See the
shapechanging section for more details.

<b>Berserk fury:</b>                                                                    
     Drives you into a berserk fury, which greatly increases your strength,      
melee skill, and hitpoints, but hinders archery and throwing, reduces your       
armor class, and leaves you exhausted.  Requires a wrestling skill of 80 and     
the Oath of Iron.                                                                

<b>Resist damage:</b>                                                                   
     Lets you go into a brief trance-like state in which you take only 2/3rds    
damage from all forms of attack.  Requires a karate skill of 90 and the Oath of  
Iron.                                                                            

<b>Learn about monster:</b>                                                             
     Gives you partial information about a single monster, especially about      
attributes that would determine which weapon you might use against it.  Requires 
the Oath of Iron.                                                                

<b>Detect magic:</b>                                                                    
     Reveals most kinds of magical items nearby, which is very helpful for       
finding concentrations of neat loot.  This talent does not reveal essences.      
Requires a wizardry skill of 40.  Wizards use a spell instead.                   

<b>Phase warp:</b>                                                                      
     Semi-controlled teleport.  At levels not much above the minimum, is only    
slightly better than a phase door, but at high levels, gives good control of     
movement.  Requires a wizardry skill of 70.  Wizards use a spell instead.        

<b>Tap magical energy:</b>                                                              
     Allows you to regain mana by tapping magical devices (especially staffs and 
wands).  This can be a very useful ability indeed, because ways to magically     
recover mana are rare.  Requires a wizardry skill of 75.  Wizards use a spell    
instead.                                                                         

<b>Sense evil:</b>                                                                      
     Detects evil monsters (even invisible ones) nearby.  Requires a holy        
alliance skill of 30.  Priests use a prayer instead.                             

<b>Restore stats:</b>                                                                   
    Instantly restores all of your vital statistics to maximum.  Requires a holy 
alliance skill of 75.  Priests use a prayer instead.                             

<b>Sense animals:</b>                                                                   
     Detects natural creatures (even invisible ones) nearby.  Requires a nature  
lore skill of 25.  Druids use a technique instead.                               

<b>Mend self:</b>                                                                       
     Reduces cuts, stuns, blindness, poison, and disease.  Requires a nature     
lore skill of 50.  At very high skill levels, allows you to heal yourself        
rapidly.  Druids use a technique instead.                                        

<b>Sense undead:</b>                                                                    
     Detects all undead monsters nearby.  Requires a blood dominion skill of 25. 
Necromancers use a ritual instead).                                              

<b>Restore experience:</b>                                                              
     Restores your skills.  This talent is very powerful, but you need a blood   
dominion skill of 85 to use it.  Necromancers use a ritual instead.              

<b>Sense charges:</b>                                                                   
     Those skilled with magical devices often automatically sense charges on     
wands and staffs.  If this automatic sensing fails, this talent guarantees       
success.  Requires a magical device skill of 70.                                 

<b>Detect and Nab objects:</b>                                                          
     Does either of two things:  1) Detects objects and gold in the current room 
and/or in line of sight, 2) Fetches an object in line of sight to you, even if a 
monster is on top of it.  The maximum weight of the object goes up with skill.   
     Requires a burglary skill of 40.                                            

<b>Poison ammo:</b>                                                                     
     Allows you to use certain mushrooms and potions to poison ammunition; such  
missiles do extra damage to all monsters not resistant to poison.  Requires a    
burglary skill of 55.                                                            

<b>Hit and run:</b>                                                                     
     Casts a spell around you; when you next hit a monster in melee, or steal    
from it, you will execute a phase door.  The neat thing is that the monster gets 
no chance to retaliate.  Requires a burglary skill of 70.                        

<b>Predict weather:</b>                                                                 
     Druids rely on this talent to tell them what the weather is like.  The      
accuracy of weather predictions goes up with perception skill, and down as you   
descend into the dungeon.  A druid needs to wait some time between forecasts,    
but may get automatic reports when the weather changes (again, depending on      
perception skill and dungeon depth).                                             

<b>Sense area:</b>                                                                      
     Magically maps the local area, revealing walls and floors (but not objects  
or monsters).  Requires a perception skill of 55.  Eventually gains extended     
range.                                                                           

<b>Sneaking:</b>                                                                        
     When you use this talent (or type the 'S' (or '#') key), you start to sneak 
around.  This slows you down but makes you more stealthy (depends on stealth     
skill).  Also, the higher your Burglary skill, the more likely that you will get 
especially deadly sneak attacks (much more effective than the ordinary sleeping  
monster bonus) on sleeping monsters.  Requires a stealth skill of 10.            

<b>Superstealth:</b>                                                                    
     Temporarily makes you partially invisible.  Power depends on stealth and is 
in addition to any equipment bonuses to invisibility.  Requires a stealth skill  
of 75.                                                                           

<b>Recharging:</b>                                                                      
     Allows you to use essences to recharge wands, staffs, and even rods.  This  
method is riskier to you than normal recharging, but is much less likely to blow 
up the item you are working on.  Of course, you have to find the right kind of   
essences first.  Requires a magical infusion skill of 30, and a magical device   
skill of 30.                                                                     

<b>Weapon forging:</b>                                                                  
     Allows you to create weapons using components.  Requires a weapon forging   
skill of 15.  Increases in skill greatly improve your ability to make powerful   
weapons.                                                                         

<b>Armor forging:</b>                                                                   
     Allows you to create armor using components.  Requires an armor forging     
skill of 15.  Increases in skill greatly improve your ability to make powerful   
armor.                                                                           

<b>Bowmaking and Fletchery:</b>                                                         
     Allows you to create bows and ammunition using components.  Requires a      
bowmaking skill of 15.  Increases in skill greatly improve your ability to make  
powerful bows and missiles.                                                      

<b>Alchemy:</b>                                                                         
     Allows you to create potions, scrolls, rings, and amulets using bottles,    
parchments, and essences.  Requires an alchemy skill of 10.  Increases in skill  
greatly improve your ability to make powerful weapons.                           

<b>Dragon-breathing:</b>                                                                
     If you are in dragonform, you can use this talent to consume essences and   
breathe them out in powerful breaths.  The amount of damage you do depends on    
your total power and on the type of essence you choose (the more likely the      
breath is to be resisted, the more damage it does).                              
     Of course, you have to find a way to turn into a dragon first...            

<H4>Warrior Talents ('p')</H4>

<b>Lunge</b>                                                                            
	 Attack a monster two squares away.  Suffer a penalty to attack from the     
distance.  Requires the Oath of Iron.                                            
	 
<b>Whirlwind Attack</b>                                                                 
	 Attack all monsters nearby in a spinning attack.  Requires a weapon, and a
weapon skill of 30 or more.                                                      
	 
<b>Circle Kick</b>                                                                 
	 Attempts to stun all monsters surrounding you, becoming more powerful with  
your karate skill.  Requires a karate skill of 30 or more.                       
	 
<b>Impact Blow</b>                                                                 
	 Attack and knock back a monster.  Requires a blunt weapon and hafted skill  
of 30.                                                                           
	 
<b>Earthquakes</b>                                                                 
	 Call the walls down around you to provide cover.  Requires a blunt weapon,  
the oath of iron, and hafted skill of 60.                                        



<H3>Other skills-based abilities</H3>
<b>Dodging Ability:</b>                                                                 
     Dodging skill is the most important factor in overall dodging ability, as   
shown on your character screen.  However, several other things can make a big    
difference.                                                                      

Conditions:  When paralyzed, blinded, confused, hallucinating, or stunned, your  
dodging ability is greatly reduced.  An extremely high dodging skill (above 95)  
allows you to ignore most of these conditions.                                   

Dexterity:  You need a Dexterity above 7 to dodge much at all.  Each point above 
this increases your potential dodging (assuming you have the skill).             

Weight:  Carrying too much relative to your strength reduces your dodging        
ability, and wielded shields are by far the worst offenders.  However, increases 
in dodging skill boost the percentage you can carry without penalty.             

Special:  Some spells increase dodging ability temporarily.  Burglars moving in  
the dark get a bonus.  It is hard to dodge in the water.                         



<H2><A NAME="2.6X">Object Forging</A></H2><A HREF="manual.html#2.">(return)</A>

<H3>Supplies</H3>
     When using an object-forging talent, you usually need some kind of input.   
You can only create weapons, armor, and missiles in the town (except in ironman  
mode).                                                                           

<b>Components:</b>                                                                      
     Components of metal come in several different types; the higher level the   
component, the more powerful the weapon, armor, or missiles that can be forged   
from it.  Certain components add special qualities to the items they create;     
mithril is unusually light, adamantium unusually heavy, and both ignore acid and 
fire.                                                                            

<b>Bottles:</b>                                                                         
     You need empty bottles to create potions.  You start saving empty bottles   
as soon as you get your alchemy skill up to 10.  Bottles come in several         
varieties; the higher level the bottle, the less likely potions made from it     
will shatter when frozen.                                                        

<b>Parchments:</b>                                                                      
     You need blank parchments to create scrolls.  You start saving parchments   
as soon as you get your alchemy skill up to 10.  Parchments come in several      
varieties; the higher level the parchment, the less likely scrolls made from it  
will burn or be destroyed by acid.                                               

<b>Essences:</b>                                                                        
     Essences are foci of concentrated magic; they slowly gather near objects    
and monsters with strong attributes of a particular type.  Every poisonous snake 
on a newly created level has some chance of having attracted an essence of       
poison, fire-branded weapons might have attracted essences of fire, and potions  
of cure critical wounds might have attracted essences of healing.  Objects and   
monsters generated while you are exploring the level cannot have attracted       
essences, because they haven't stayed in one place long enough.                  
     Essences cannot be detected with magic; you have to find them the old-      
fashioned way, by thoroughly investigating places where you think they might be. 
The higher your Magical Infusion (and also Perception) skills, the more essences 
you will find.  Essences are more numerous but harder to spot deep in the        
dungeon.  Once you find an essence, you pick it up by moving onto it.  It        
automatically goes into a special pouch slot in your equipment; you may          
'I'nspect or e'x'amine this pouch to see what essences you have.                 


<H3>Forging Wargear</H3>
<b>What you need:</b>                                                                   
     Weapon, armor, and missile forging all compete for the same kind of input:  
components.  The more skilled you are, and the better the component you choose,  
the greater the maximum power of the object you create.                          
     You also need some moderate skill in using any weapon you forge, or it will 
be less powerful.  For example, if you don't have any throwing or clubbing       
skill, then you cannot make such powerful throwing or blunt weapons.             

<b>Object types:</b>                                                                    
     The actual power of the forged item greatly depends on your choice of base  
object.  Melee weapons and body armor can have a lot of attributes; other kinds  
of armor and missile weapons have somewhat less, and ammunition has only a few.  
Also, the higher level and more powerful the base object, the fewer extra        
attributes it gets.                                                              

<b>Reducing failure chance:</b>                                                         
     Forging may fail, and when it does, things go boom.  You reduce your        
failure chance by increasing your skill, using higher quality components, and    
choosing low-level base object types (daggers versus executioner's swords).      

     You can give your forged items names by inscribing them.                    


<H3>Infusion of Wargear</H3>
     When you forge wargear with essences in your pouch, you will be asked if    
you want to use essences to directly alter your forged item.  If you say yes,    
you see the "Add essences" screens.  There are four screens:  Sustain/Slay,      
Resist, Qualities, and Bonuses.  You navigate among them by typing '<' and '>'.  
Pressing RETURN starts the forging.  Pressing ESC cancels everything.            

<b>Investing essences:</b>                                                              
     On all screens, you see a list of object attributes (such as Resist Cold or 
Sustain Strength), each followed by an indication of the essence type and the    
minimum amount needed to get it.  If you have at least the required amount of    
essences of that type, the essence type is displayed in grey.  Otherwise, it is  
shown in dark grey.  You navigate to the attribute you want by typing '8' and    
'2', then invest essences by typing '+' and '-'.  As you invest essences, the    
number invested appears, colored grey, white, light blue, blue, and violet as    
your likelihood of success increases.  Investing the minimum gives you a 30%     
chance of success.  Investing until the indicator is violet (quite expensive)    
gives you a 90% chance of getting that attribute; this is the highest possible.  

<b>Applying bonuses:</b>                                                                
     On the bonuses screen, you also need to specify which bonus you plan to     
apply, as objects may have up to three.  Usually, however, you just need to      
adjust the first one (by typing '+' and '-').  Navigate to the attribute you     
want, and type '4' and '6' to change to the bonus you want (usually the first).  
Once you have assigned that attribute a non-zero bonus, you can then invest      
essences (by typing '+' and '-').  Note that the cost of bonuses depends greatly 
on the size of bonus you ask for.  Asking for a bonus of 3 is more expensive     
then asking for 3 different bonuses of 1.                                        

<b>Be careful:</b>                                                                      
     Object infusion can be extremely powerful, but you have to be careful.  The 
greater the percentage of total power you try to specify using essences, the     
more likely it is that the forging will fail, and that you will lose everything. 
Infusion skill helps a lot with this.  The infusion screens display a            
"Potential" indicator; it changes colors from green to light green, white,       
yellow, orange, red, and dark grey as things get increasingly dangerous.         
     Again:  forging is very, very chancy.  Magic-using smiths and alchemists    
are notorious for rearranging the landscape.  If you fail, just remember that    
there are lots more essences and components waiting to be found.                 


<H3>Alchemy</H3>
<b>Making potions (requires a skill of 10):</b>                                         
     Potion-creation requires essences and bottles.  You can only make potions   
that you are aware of and whose essence cost you can meet.  The higher your      
alchemy skill, the higher the maximum level of potions you can make.             
     Alchemy can fail, and when it does, the potion you are working on explodes  
violently.  You increase your success rate by choosing low-level potions, high-  
level bottles, and by raising your alchemy skill.                                
     You can often make more than one potion using a given number of essences;   
the amount depends on the value of the potion and your infusion skill.  Making   
more than one potion at a time is especially risky, but increases in infusion    
skill help.                                                                      

<b>Alchemy - making scrolls (requires a skill of 10):</b>                               
     Scroll-creation is very similar to potion-creation except that you use      
parchments instead of bottles.                                                   

<b>Alchemy - making rings and amulets (requires a skill of 35):</b>                     
     Making rings and amulets needs both components and essences.  The level of  
object you can make depends on alchemy skill and component quality.  Failure     
chance depends on the level of the item you are trying to create and on your     
skill.                                                                           

<b>Infusion - making potions of essences:</b>                                           
     Requires an Infusion skill of 15.  Uses the same talent as ordinary potion- 
making (so you also need enough Alchemy skill to make potions).                  
     Potions of essences ("magical grenades") can do a lot of damage, whether    
you throw them, quaff them, or use them in traps.  Damage depends on the number  
of essences you pack in and on your Infusion skill.  The type of essences you    
use also has an effect:  the basic elements do the most damage, the esoteric     
magics do the least.  If you pack too many essences in, and fail to use a sturdy 
enough bottle, your potion might explode...                                      

     Average damage:                                                             
     skill * 1.4 (up to 140) for one essence                                     
     skill * 2.2 (up to 220) for two essences                                    
     skill * 2.8 (up to 280) for three essences                                  

     Note:  You can make multiple potions of essences at one time.  Unlike the   
case when making ordinary potions, there is no extra risk to doing this.

     You begin your adventures in the town.  It consists of eight buildings,     
each with a shop entranceway (and one also with an inn), and is well populated.  
The first time you are in town it will be daytime, but the sun rises and sets as

your character grew up in this world of intrigue, no experience is awarded for   
killing the town inhabitants, though you may acquire treasure.                   


<H3>Stores</H3>
     You enter buildings by walking onto their entranceways, which (in text      
mode) are represented by numbers from 1 to 8 or the '+' sign.                    
     A new display then replaces the old.  For most buildings, you see the name  
and race of the store owner, the name of the store, and the maximum number of    
gold pieces that the store owner will pay for any one item.  Below it is         
displayed the inventory; if it is numerous, you may display another page by      
typing space.  Near the bottom of the screen is displayed a list of commonly-    
used commands.                                                                   
- 'g' or 'p': get/purchase an item.                                              
- 'd' or 's': drop/sell an item.                                                 
- 'I': inspect an item (reveals any known special properties, reads spellbooks)  
- ESC:  leave the store.

     Here you may store objects that you cannot carry on your travels or will

<H3>Buying and Selling</H3>
     Store owners have individual personalities; often their names are a         
valuable hint.  Some can offer a great deal of money, but never seem to hold any 
sales; others cannot pay nearly what your valuable items are worth, but often    
give great deals.  The price of items that change hands depends on their base    
cost, how well your and the store owner's races get along*, your Charisma, and   
the innate greediness of the store owner.                                        

     * Everyone likes his or her own race best.                                  
     * Humans will trade with anyone, and nobody really hates them.              
     * Dwarves and orcs are at war; dwarves and elves don't much get along.      
     * Nobody loves a Half-Orc or Half-Troll but another orc or troll.           

     Stores never have everything in stock; as time passes, their inventory      
slowly changes (but only when you are in the dungeon).  Store owners fully       
identify everything you sell them; you also become aware of objects of that      
type.                                                                            

<b>Bargaining:</b>                                                                      
     Price also depends on one factor more:  your skill at bargaining.  The      
shopkeeper will immediately go to his final price on low-priced items, but for   
more valuable things, you need to haggle a little.  As you glance over a store's 
inventory, you will notice that some prices are in grey rather than white; they  
are items that you should bargain for.                                           
     If you are selling something, a typical haggling session starts with the    
shopkeeper assuring you that a good price is something like 50-70% of what the   
item is really worth.  You demand maybe twice or three times this, and the       
bargaining begins.  You bring your price closer to the shopkeeper's offer, and   
he then does the same for you.  The best way to change a price is to enter "-20" 
or "+20", instead of retyping a new figure.  After some rounds, you and the      
shopkeeper will meet somewhere in the middle.                                    
     The key to success is to change your price neither too little (which will   
insult the shopkeeper) nor too much (which is a sign of inexperience, and will   
be taken advantage of).  Some shopkeepers like to haggle more, other are         
impatient and demand good offers, but you have always have enough leeway to      
succeed.                                                                         
     If you've gotten the shopkeeper to admit his final price, and you close the 
sale, your reputation with him goes up.  If you accept a bad deal (no "Final     
offer"), your reputation goes down.  The higher your reputation as a haggler,    
the more items that the shopkeeper will just go straight to his final price on   
(he knows he can't fool you).  It is quite possible to get a shopkeeper to       
immediately offer the final price on just about everything.                      
     Just be careful not to antagonize the shopkeepers too much.  You have to    
work at it, but you can get any shopkeeper mad enough to throw you out of the    
store.  When this happens, you can't get back in for quite some time, perhaps    
three or four days.  Fortunately, shopkeepers are forgiving souls:  as time      
passes, they will forget any unhappiness you've caused them.  Shopkeepers also   
forget an insult every time you buy or sell anything; if you want to get back in 
the Temple's good graces, buy some potions of Cure Light Wounds.  One at a time. 

     There is an option to auto-haggle, but be warned:  Those who blithely       
accept the shopkeeper's prices pay a markup.  The higher the value of the item,  
the higher that markup; it is nothing for anything under 250 gold and up to 33   
percent for really expensive things.                                             

<b>Stores can upgrade their inventory:</b>                                              
     Every time you buy something new, especially something valuable, from a     
store, it has more money to spend on items it wouldn't normally carry.  As time  
passes, and you continue to patronize particular stores, you will notice two     
things:  firstly, the shopkeepers will start paying special attention to you,    
and secondly, that they will begin to stock a few unusual items.  It takes quite 
a while, but stores can significantly upgrade their inventory over time.         
     Be aware that shopkeepers mark up the prices of these unusual items.  For   
valuable things, this markup can be considerable.                                

<b>Investing in stores:</b>                                                             
     You can also give shopkeepers money directly by investing in their store.   
Use the '*' command, then type 'I' to invest money.  In addition to making the   
store more likely to stock nice stuff, investing in stores also improves the     
shopkeeper's attitude, and may make him forget any bad bargains.                 

<b>Shopkeepers can retire and be replaced:</b>                                          
     Shopkeepers do retire, but only very rarely.  The new shopkeeper benefits   
from all of the money you've spent at the store, and has a good (but not         
perfect) idea of how good a haggler you are.                                     
     If you completely buy out a store's inventory, the shopkeeper may offer to  
retire.  He'll demand a fortune, though.                                         


<H3>Getting quests</H3>
    You take on quests by going to the Inn and choosing one from the list.  As   
you succeed in more quests, and take on greater challenges, the rewards for      
success can become great indeed.                                                 
     When you accept a quest, you have lots of time to prepare for it.  However, 
once you enter the quest level, you cannot leave for any length of time without  
running a risk of failing the quest.  Failure reduces your prestige, and you may 
get poorer rewards from the quest-givers until you recover their respect.        

     Be warned:  If you are not a really good player, "moderate" and "difficult" 
quests can get your characters killed fast!                                      



<H2><A NAME="3.3X">The Dungeon</A></H2><A HREF="manual.html#3.">(return)</A>

     All levels other than 0 (or zero feet) lie within the dungeon.  Each level  
of the dungeon is fifty feet high, and is divided into large rectangular regions 
(several times larger than the screen) by impenetrable walls.  Once you leave a  
level, you will never again find your way back to that region of that level, but 
there are an infinite number of other regions at that same depth that you can    
explore later.  Monsters move about just as you do, and you may see them again.  


<H3>Terrain</H3>
     The following terrain types affect movement, combat, or both.  Because they 
less frequently take advantage of terrain, monsters benefit more from favorable  
and suffer less from unfavorable terrain than your character does.               

<b>Rubble:</b>                                                                          
     Greatly slows down any creature that cannot bore or pass through rock.      
Ends LOS, stops missiles, bolts, and beams, and reduces the radius of ball       
spells.  Grants the character and monsters within it some protection from melee, 
ranged, or magical attacks.  Rubble may dissolve to normal floor.                

<b>Water:</b>                                                                           
     Cannot be passed by fiery, earthbound monsters, slows down other most other 
monsters.  Slows you down, and cannot be crossed if you are carrying too much.   
You and your enemies are easier to hit when in water, and most spells            
(especially water-based ones) gain in strength.  It is hard to dodge in water.   
However, fire-based spells become much less powerful, so find a lake if you      
battle Smaug.  Water may evaporate.                                              

<b>Lava:</b>                                                                            
     Can be passed by any character, but inflicts substantial fire damage (less  
for players with feather fall - they're light on their feet).  All monsters      
other than fiery or strong flying creatures will not cross.  Water and cold-     
based spells suffer and fire-based spells become more powerful against a target  
in lava.  Lava may freeze to rubble or normal floor.                             

<b>Trees:</b>                                                                           
     Slows down characters not familiar with druidic techniques, and all non-    
natural monsters that neither fly nor pass through rock.  Ends LOS, stops        
missiles, bolts, and beams, and reduces the radius of ball spells.  Grants the   
character and monsters within it some protection from melee, ranged, or magical  
attacks.  Trees can burn.                                                        

<b>Permanent walls:</b>                                                                 
     You can dig through most walls but some are impenetrable.  The dungeon is   
surrounded by these kinds of walls and some special rooms are made of them.      

<b>Staircases:</b>                                                                      
     Staircases allow your character to ascend or descend from one level to      
another, and are represented by "<" (up) and ">" (down).  Each level has at      
least one up staircase, and two down staircases, unless it is the home of Sauron 
(level 99/4950') or Morgoth (level 100/5000'), whom you must kill before         
staircases will appear.  Otherwise, the staircases are guaranteed, but they may  
be difficult to find.  Once you leave a level, you can never return to it.  If   
you found an artifact, identified it, and left it on the level, it is            
permanently lost.  Watch out for spells and traps that can suddenly force you    
off the level.                                                                   

<b>Secret doors:</b>                                                                    
     Many secret doors exist in the dungeon, and may lead to anything from a new 
section of the dungeon level to an empty closet.  As your familiarity with the   
dungeon grows, you will know where many secret doors are likely to be.  Secret   
doors always look like granite until found.  You find hidden doors using the     
's'earch command, or magic.                                                      

<b>Locked and stuck doors:</b>                                                          
     Doors may be locked or stuck; getting through them may not be easy.  Your   
disarming skill makes all the difference to your ability to handle locks, but    
you can also bash doors down, take a pickaxe to them, or blast them open with    
magic.                                                                           
     Monsters are also slowed down by doors; you can earn yourself valuable time 
by jamming or locking them.                                                      

<b>Open doors:</b>                                                                      
     Open doors (if unbroken) may be closed.  If a monster is in the way, you    
instead attempt to slam the door:  The monster gets a free turn, then you        
attempt to close the door.  If you succeed, the monster retreats out of the way  
and loses a turn.                                                                

<b>Traps:</b>                                                                           
     Traps also await you in the dungeon.  They look like normal terrain until   
found, too often by your being caught by one.  They start out weak and easy to   
disarm, but can get truly nasty further down...                                  
     You find hidden traps by using the 's'earch command.  Many characters can   
also use magic and everyone can use the appropriate magical device.  Be warned:  
although magical disarming is convenient, it is never a sure thing.              

<b>Rooms:</b>                                                                           
     The Pits of Angband contain many kinds of rooms, including some that house  
hordes of monsters, contain extraordinary items, or are filled with deadly       
traps.  Some special rooms, known as vaults, are extremely dangerous and         
lucrative.                                                                       

<b>Mining:</b>                                                                          
     There is much treasure in the walls of the dungeon, just waiting for an     
industrious adventurer to come and dig it out.  Once you can afford it, and if   
you can handle the weight, bring a shovel or pick along.  Your ability to tunnel 
depends on strength, weapon weight, and any special digging bonus the weapon     
<b>provides.  Your success depends on these factors and the strength of the wall:</b>   
granite is very hard, quartz is hard, magma is soft, and rubble is very soft.    
     As you get richer, the treasures in the wall won't seem so appealing        
anymore, but keep an item or spell of tunneling handy.  Not only do all sorts of 
special vaults lie deep below the surface, some completely enclosed by solid     
rock, but smart adventurers deliberately alter the dungeon to make the most      
dangerous breathers and summoners manageable.                                    


<H3>Exploring</H3>
<b>Light:</b>                                                                           
     Your character must have some source of light in order to see, unless the   
area around him is magically lit.  Depending on the items he has equipped, he    
may have a light radius of one (torches with low fuel), two (a lantern or well-  
fueled torch), or more, up to a rarely-attained maximum of five.  Never risk     
being without light ... unless you know what you are doing.                      
     A torch or lantern (usually) burns fuel, and may be refilled (use the       
'F'uel command) with other torches or flasks of oil respectively.  It is         
rumoured that other light sources exist which never need replenishing.  Light    
sources can be lit or doused (use the '(' command).   When lit, they will        
illuminate the surrounding area, even when placed on the floor.  They will       
automatically light up when equipped, and will neither shed light nor use fuel   
in your backpack.                                                                
     In addition you may get access to spells which permanently light up areas   
of the dungeon; these can be truly handy, because a monster you can see coming   
is much less dangerous.                                                          

<b>Darkness:</b>                                                                        
     But darkness can be useful too.  Unseen monsters are harder to hit with     
physical attacks, and take less damage from spells (because you can't aim at     
them precisely).  You, likewise, are harder to hit if in and surrounded by       
darkness, and will take less damage from ranged attacks.  Depending on your      
skills, staying in darkness may yield other advantages as well.                  

<b>Food and Regeneration:</b>                                                           
     Never risk being without food.  You must eat every so often in order to     
avoid starvation.  The speed at which you consume food depends on your race      
(trolls and giants need to eat a lot) and the items you wear.                    
     The speed at which you regenerate is doubled when you are resting (so rest  
in place instead of staying in place whenever possible), and is also affected by 
various object attributes and temporary conditions.                              

<b>Noise:</b>                                                                           
     Characters make a certain amount of noise all the time; this innate noise   
decreases as stealth improves.  Moving more quickly increases noise somewhat     
because you perform more actions in a given period of time.  Resting, sneaking,  
and (if you have any stealth skill) moving in the dark all reduce base noise     
substantially.                                                                   
     To base noise is added extra noise.  Every time you engage in combat, cast  
most kinds of spells that hurt monsters, bash a door or a chest, kill a monster, 
or wreck the dungeon, you make extra noise.  Extra noise dies down over time.    
     Sleeping monsters will be disturbed by noise, especially if you are nearby  
and/or are in line of sight.  You may deliberately make noise by using the Bash  
command.                                                                         

<b>Searching and Detection:</b>                                                         
     The dungeon is full of secret doors and hidden traps.  Perception skill is  
crucial for automatically finding traps and secret doors as you move around,     
especially deep in the dungeon where they become very hard to find.  You can     
also actively hunt for hidden things by typing 's' to search for a turn.   This  
is much more effective and requires less perception skill.  However, the most    
powerful way to reveal traps and secret doors is magic:  spells exist that make  
finding doors and avoiding traps a easy task.                                    
     The one thing that no magic spell can find for you is essences.  Once your  
Magical infusion skill is at least 15, you start to notice essences, both        
automatically and by deliberately searching.  As you descend into the dungeon,   
be sure to keep raising your Magical infusion skill (raising Perception helps    
also, but not as much), because high-level essences are much harder to find.     

<b>Level Feelings:</b>                                                                  
     Spend enough time on a given level and you will get a message describing    
it.  The more interesting the choice of adjectives, the more dangerous and       
lucrative the level is likely to be.  At the same time, the depth indicator      
located at the bottom-right corner of the main screen will change color.  Whites 
and yellows indicate relatively quiet levels, but oranges and reds mean danger   
and rewards.                                                                     
     Things that boost level feelings include:  out of depth monsters (small     
effect), out of depth uniques (larger effect), out of depth objects, artifacts   
and other powerful kinds of objects, and very unusual rooms.                     
     You will occasionally get the message "You feel there is something special  
about this level.", indicating that this is either a quest level, or that there  
is an active player ghost lurking there.  Artifacts and special rooms do not     
make a level special.                                                            

<b>Precognition Messages:</b>                                                           
     If your Perception skill is great enough, you will start to get             
"precognition" messages indicating the presence of many of the individual        
monsters, objects, and special rooms that boost level feelings.  Unlike level    
feelings, they appear immediately.  The higher you raise your Perception, the    
more specific - and accurate - these messages become.                            


<H3>The Passage of Time</H3>
     Both monsters and characters gain energy each turn and use it to perform    
actions.  Any creature that moves at normal speed gains 10 energy per game turn; 
any monster move and most character actions take 100 energy.  Some monsters move 
at double speed and you can too, if you quaff a Potion of Speed.  Actions still  
take the same amount of energy, but they and you gain twice the energy each      
turn.  Further down, monsters lurk that move even faster, and rare items exist   
that allow you to keep pace.  If you can, avoid being slower than your foes.     

<b>An abbreviated speed-to-energy table:</b>

   +5      : 15

  +15      : 25

  +30      : 38 (energy only goes up very slowly above +30 speed)                

<b>Regeneration and recovery:</b>                                                       
     Every 10 game turns, you regenerate some hitpoints and mana (unless you are 
ill or wounded), and get hurt by cuts and poison.  Temporary conditions count    
down, rods recharge, and light sources use fuel.  Every 100 game turns, you      
digest some food.  Every hundred thousand game turns equals one day; the town    
spends half that time in darkness and the other half in light.                   
     Every 10 game turns, every monster on the level gets a chance to recover    
from all temporary conditions.  Every 100 game turns, monsters regenerate        
hitpoints.

<b>Monsters are worth experience:</b>                                                   
     Defeat a monster, and you will gain experience.  The amount you gain        
depends on the base monster value (which goes up rapidly deeper in the dungeon). 
This is divided by your own total experience value:  the combination of spent    
plus unspent experience, ranging from 1 to 100.  Note that raising skills has no 
effect whatsoever on this value.                                                 

<b>Your Monster Memory:</b>                                                             
     When you see a monster for the first time, all you know are its physical    
attributes and whatever information the monster description may provide.  As you 
fight and kill monsters, use various attacks on them, probe them with magic, and 
get killed by them, you learn more about their strengths and weaknesses.         
     You recall this memory in one of two ways:  'l'ooking at / e'x'amining the  
monster and then pressing 'r' for recall, or by pressing '/' and typing the      
monster's letter.                                                                
     Unlike object memory, monster memory can be passed on even after your       
character dies, by loading his savefile and creating a new character.            


<b>The Monster Health Bar:</b>                                                          
     A good way to keep track of a specific monster is to target it.  When you   
do so, its health bar appears on the left side of the main screen, just below    
the hitpoint and mana indicators.  Similar health bars are also used when        
looking around and when displaying the closest monsters.                         
     The health bar uses several colors to tell you more about the monster.      
Frightened - violet, Confused - brown, Stunned - light blue, Sleeping - dark     
blue.  Otherwise - dark and light green when healthy, and yellow, orange, and    
red when wounded.                                                                
     The health bar is bracketed in green when you have direct line of fire to   
the monster, in white when monsters block your line of fire, and grey when walls 
or something else non-passable does.                                             

<b>Extra monster health bars:</b>                                                       
     You can display additional monster health bars on the left side of your     
main screen or (in most interfaces) in separate windows.  Consult the options    
section for more details.                                                        

<b>Monster attributes:</b>                                                              
     The special attributes of monsters can make all the difference to the       
danger they pose to you.  Some of the more interesting are listed and described. 

  Hitpoints : Some monsters die easily, others can withstand almost anything.    
  Armor : Some monsters are easy to hit with melee blows or missiles, others     
       very difficult.                                                           
  Awareness : Some monsters will stay asleep even if you dance in front of them, 
       others are ever vigilant.  The distance that monsters can perceive you    
      (if you are not in line of sight) also varies greatly.                     

  Color : The color of a monster can be a valuable hint; different kinds         
       of power and magic are associated with particular colors.                 
  Multi-hued : Changes colors randomly.  Often you can tell what a dragon        
       can breathe by watching it flicker.                                       
  Invisible : Cannot be seen with normal sight.                                  
  Warm-blooded : Some monsters can be seen with infravision, others can not.     
  Telepathy : Some monsters are always visible with telepathy, others are        
       rarely visible, and others still never visible.                           
  Uses symbol : Appears exactly like whatever terrain it is on.                  
  Shining : Can be seen even in shadow                                           

  Groups : Monsters may appear in groups, or have escorts.                       
  Multiply : Some monsters breed explosively!                                    

  Drops : Monsters may drop anything from nothing at all to large quantities     
       of marvelous objects.                                                     
  Experience : The experience you get from killing monsters varies greatly.      

  Regenerate : Recovers battle damage unusually quickly.                         
  Evasive : Monster is especially hard to hit with melee blows, missiles, or     
       bolt spells.                                                              
  Clouds : Monster constantly releases clouds of venom, fire, etc. around it.    
       Approaching such creatures is especially hazardous.                       

  Bash Door : Most monsters (but not all) can either bash down or open doors.    
       Everyone can close doors, and some characters can lock or bar doors to    
       delay their foes considerably.                                            
  Pass Wall : Ghosts and some other creatures can float right through ordinary   
       walls.                                                                    
  Flying : Can float or fly over hostile terrain or monster traps.               

  Hurt by ... : Monsters can be especially susceptible to light, rock remover,   
       fire, or cold.                                                            
  Resistant to ... : Monsters can be especially resistant to edged and/or blunt  
       weapons, any or all of the elements or poison, or any of the esoteric     
       magics.                                                                   
  Cannot be ... : Monsters can be immune to fear, slowing, stunning, sleeping,   
       or confusion.                                                             

  Spells : Monsters may fire physical missiles, breathe, cast spells to hurt and 
       hinder you, blink and teleport you and themselves, heal and cure and      
       restore themselves, haste themselves or other monsters, summon more       
       opponents, and many other things!                                         
  Casting speed : Be careful of monsters that cast spells very often, especially 
       if they also move quickly.                                                
  Smart : Monsters can be skilled at choosing spells, somewhat skilled, or       
       unskilled.                                                                
  Breath Powerfully : Dragon breaths lose less power with range.                 
  Archer : Can fire physical missiles most of the time.                          
  Morgul-Spells : Poisonous missiles, and cold, poison, and darkness spells      
       become much more nasty.                                                   
  Spells of Udun : Fire become Hellfire, a dreadful combination of darkness and  
       fire.                                                                     

  Blows : Monsters can do great damage and inflict nasty effects in melee.  A    
       few monsters never miss.                                                  


<b>Detecting monsters:</b>                                                              
     There are many ways to find out if monsters are nearby.  Bright light       
reveals all but invisible creatures; if you can light up an area, you are much   
less likely to be surprised.  Many spells and magical devices, and some talents  
detect monsters, and you may perhaps be able to find and wear an item that       
grants telepathy.                                                                
     A number of skills can also be very helpful here, as they allow you to      
sense nearby creatures.  The effect of each skill is given below.                

     Nature Lore:  powerful detection of natural creatures                       
     Holy Alliance:  powerful detection of demonic creatures, some ability       
          to sense evil at high level                                            
     Blood Dominion:  powerful detection of undead creatures                     
     Wizardry:  some detection of magic-users with mana at high level            

     Stealth:  If you are in pitch darkness, gives you a significant bonus       
          when listening for monsters                                            
     Perception:  perception skill may reveal invisible creatures adjacent       
          to you, and at high level this skill can help you hear distant         
          monsters not mentioned above                                           
     Burglary (Guild):  general bonus to hearing and sensing ability             


<b>Player Ghosts:</b>                                                                   
     Player ghosts vary from game to game depending on the name, sex, race, and  
spell realm of the adventurer or legendary Hero whose bones file was used during 
ghost creation.  Should your character die, information about him will often be  
added to a new bones file, inside the folder /lib/bones, and a future game might 
bring him back from the dead...                                                  
     Should a ghost be slain, he may vanish forever, or he may re-emerge later   
in a new, more powerful form!

     The mines far below the surface are full of objects just waiting to be      
picked up and used.  The treasures of long-forgotten kingdoms, dragon's hoards,  
heirlooms, wizard's stashes, and the plunder from every age of the world unite   
with the scattered earthly possessions of all the foolish adventurers who died   
before you to offer unimaginable wealth for those bold enough to seize it.       


<H3>Learning about objects</H3>
<b>Learning about objects:</b>                                                          
     When you begin the game, most objects are unknown to you, and an important  
task is to learn more about them so that you can use them reliably.  The         
standard way to learn about an object is to identify it, but scrolls of Identify 
and Staffs of Perception don't come cheap.  They also don't work on everything;  
mushrooms cannot be identified with magic.                                       

<b>Full identification:</b>                                                             
     Some items have special powers.  Ego-item descriptions usually tell you     
everything, but artifacts are known only by legend.  A number of items (usually  
artifacts and ego-items) may have random powers.  To learn absolutely everything 
about an object, read a scroll of *identify* on it.  Such scrolls are rare and   
expensive; if you don't have access to one, try using the object a lot and       
inscribing it.                                                                   
     Fully identified objects have light blue indexes, identified objects have   
white, and unknown objects grey.                                                 

<b>Scanning wargear automatically (Pseudo-ID):</b>                                      
     The first time you walk over a weapon, missile, or piece of armor, you      
examine it for anything unusual.  Your ability to learn about wargear depends on 
your perception skill, modified by any bonuses to awareness granted by equipped  
items.                                                                           
     When you wear or wield such an item, you examine it again, this time more   
closely and with a greater chance of success.  Given a decent perception skill,  
you have a pretty good shot at learning something.  Be careful though:  Objects  
may be cursed and need special magic to remove!                                  

Scanned objects are marked with the following inscriptions                       
   Item description               low perception          high perception        
   average item:                  "unknown"               "average"              
   item with plusses              "good"                  "good"                 
   ego-item (weapon of flame)     "good"                  "excellent"            
   artifact (unique item)         "good"                  "special"              
   cursed artifact                "cursed"                "terrible"             
   cursed ego-item                "cursed"                "worthless"            
   cursed ordinary object         "cursed"                "cursed"               
   failed to learn anything       "unknown", no message appears                  

     Once you equip the weapon or armor, and if it is actually better (or worse) 
then the inscription claims, you will eventually learn more about it as you use  
it in battle.  An ego-item that was originally marked "unknown" will first be    
revealed as "good", then as "excellent".                                         
     Characters who have taken the Oath of Iron are especially good at scanning  
wargear, and (if their perception skill is fairly high) will be able to          
instantly identify any weapon or armor they equip.                               

<b>Sensing other wearable objects:</b>                                                  
     You can often learn about rings and amulets by putting them on, and, if     
that doesn't work, by wearing them for a while.  This also gives you experience. 
However, rings and amulets are often cursed...                                   

<b>Learning about magical devices:</b>                                                  
     You can learn the name of magical devices that you successfully use; when   
you do, you get experience.                                                      
     If your perception and/or magical device skills are good enough, you can    
learn about the charges on wands and staffs, especially low-level ones.  Bonuses 
to awareness also work here.                                                     
     Use most magical devices often enough, especially if your perception and    
magical device skills are high, and you will eventually learn more about the     
damage they do or the power they have.  You may check this information by using  
the 'I'nspect command.                                                           

<b>Learning about potions and scrolls:</b>                                              
     There are three ways to learn about potions and scrolls:  You can sell      
them, identify them, or learn about them by using them.  Learning by using is    
risky but highly rewarding.  Not only do you get a lot of experience this way    
(if the object is unsensed), but many scrolls and potions are more powerful when 
you read or quaff them unaware (and unsensed).  If you quaff unaware every       
potion that attacks stats, and every one that improves them, your total stat     
gain will improve by about 4.                                                    

<b>Learning about mushrooms:</b>                                                        
     You must eat mushrooms in order to learn about them.  There are some very   
useful 'shrooms out there, but also some truly nasty ones...                     


<H3>Object information</H3>
     'I'nspecting a specific object will pop up a special display that tells you 
useful things about the object kind, legends and lore, and specific object       
attributes.                                                                      
     Known attributes of equipped items are displayed in the character screen    
display (type 'C' to bring up the character screen, then press 'h' to cycle      
through the information).  This interface is helpful when you want to optimize   
your equipment.                                                                  
     All object types that you are aware of are listed in the knowledge menu     
('~'), option 5: "Known objects".                                                


<H3>Inventory, equipment, quiver</H3>
<b>Your inventory (backpack) and equipment (your person):</b>                           
     You pick up objects by moving on top on them (if you have the "auto_pickup" 
option on), or by using the 'g'et command.  You may carry up to 23 different     
items or piles of items, and have 12 areas of your body where wearable equipment 
may go.  Press 'i', and you see the contents of your backpack; press 'e' and you 
see what you are wearing.  Both listings toggle open and closed when you press   
the space key.  Items on the floor display in similar fashion.                   
     When choosing items, you switch between inventory and equipment by pressing 
'/', and switch between the floor and either of these two by pressing '-'.       
     Carry too much weight, and you will begin to slow down, making it easier    
for monsters to kill you.  The point at which your load thus hinders you depends 
on your strength.                                                                

<b>Your quiver:</b>                                                                     
     Your equipment includes a quiver, which may hold up to ten different kinds  
of ammunition or throwing weapons.  Once placed in the quiver (using the wield   
command), they normally sort in the quiver slots just as they do in the          
backpack.  You may lock items into a specific slot, and make shooting and        
throwing a lot more convenient, by inscribing it with inscriptions similar to    
"@1", or "@f1".  Wherever you store them, ammunition and throwing weapons still  
take up space; you lose an inventory slot for every 99 missiles (or fraction     
thereof), or every 19 throwing weapons, that you place in the quiver slots.      
Ammunition and throwing weapons on the floor will automatically combine with     
similar items in the quiver, which makes cleaning up after a big fight much      
easier.                                                                          


<H3>Object types</H3>
<b>Wands:</b>                                                                           
     Known wands stack, combining their charges.  Such a stack may be heavier,   
but can be recharged more safely and effectively.  A wand must be recharged      
every so often.                                                                  

<b>Staffs:</b>                                                                          
     Staffs never stack unless in stores.  If stacked, the number of charges     
that they display is prefixed by a quantity indicator (e.g. "(2x 13 charges)",   
which shows that each of two staffs have 13 charges.  Staffs may be bulky, but   
they have lots of charges, recharge well, and are highly durable.                

<b>Rods:</b>                                                                            
     Rods always stack.  A stack of rods with at least one charging member will  
show an appropriate inscription.  When zapped, a rod is "timed out" for a given  
number of turns.  Unlike wands and staffs, rods recharge automatically.  Each    
recharging rod in a stack contributes to the total recharge rate; if three out   
of five rods are charging, the stack's total timeout period will decrease by     
three per normal player turn.                                                    

<b>Chests:</b>                                                                          
     Chests are difficult and dangerous to open, as they usually contain both    
traps and locks.  If you succeed, you may be rewarded handsomely.  If your       
disarming skill is so poor that the chest refuses to open, you can bash it into  
submission.  Of course, bashing does break things...                             

<b>Scroll of Word of Recall:</b>                                                        
     The Scroll of Word of Recall deserves special mention.  Read in the         
dungeon, it brings you back to the town.  Read in the town, it takes you as deep 
in the dungeon as you have ever gone.  This spell takes a little time to take    
effect, so don't expect it to save you in a crisis.  Should you mistakenly read  
a Scroll of Word of Recall, you may cancel it by reading another.                

<b>Ego-Weapons and Armors:</b>                                                          
     Some rare weapons and armors have special abilities.  These are called ego  
items, and are feared by great and meek.                                         

<b>Dragon Scale Mails:</b>                                                              
     These extremely rare pieces of armor come in many different colors, each    
protecting you against the relevant dragons.  They also occasionally allow you   
to breathe as dragons do!                                                        

<b>Artifacts:</b>                                                                       
     There are rumours of incredibly rare, unique artifacts which are even more  
powerful than ego items.  Some artifacts are standard, and you may already know  
of their fame, while others will certainly be unfamiliar to you and will need to 
be fully identified (*identified*).                                              
     Artifacts cannot be destroyed, although they can be disenchanted.  Once you 
find an artifact, and either sell it or identify and leave it behind, you lose   
it forever.                                                                      
     A small number of artifacts, known as Set Items, are designed to be used in 
conjunction with related items.  Equipping an entire set of these items will     
grant the wearer additional bonuses and abilities.  Item sets generally consist  
of two items, but may include more.  You may 'I'nspect an identified artifact to 
see whether it belongs to a set.                                                 


<H3>Object enhancement</H3>
     Weapons and armor may have bonuses to Skill, Deadliness, and armor class;   
it can be very useful indeed to increase these values by reading scrolls of      
Enchant Weapon and Enchant Armor.                                                
- The higher the plusses are above the object's normal values, the harder it     
  is to raise them further.                                                      
- The larger the pile of objects you try to enchant, the more likely it is that  
  you will fail.  However, ammunition and throwing weapons are unusually easy    
  to enchant.                                                                    
- You can sometimes break curses on objects and even turn them into ego-items    
  by enchanting them.                                                            


<H3>Object destruction</H3>
     Objects may be damaged or destroyed on the floor, in your backpack, and     
(sometimes) even damaged while you are wearing them.                             

- Acid destroys armor, weapons, missile launchers, ammunition, scrolls,          
  parchments, staffs, and chests.  It may damage equipped armor that does not    
  ignore acid.                                                                   
- Electricity destroys rings, amulets, wands, and (on rare occasion) rods.       
- Fire destroys torches, arrows, missile launchers, hafted weapons and polearms, 
  gloves, boots, cloaks, shields, soft body armor, spellbooks, scrolls, parch-   
  ments, staffs, and chests.                                                     
- Frost, sound, and shards destroy potions and empty bottles.  Force can also    
  destroy them, but only when they are on the floor.                             

- Many other types of magic can blow objects on the floor around, destroy them,  
  or even change ("polypile") them.                                              

- Equipped items with plusses can be disenchanted.                               
- Magical devices can be destroyed by failed recharges.                          


<H3>Cursed Objects</H3>
     Many cursed items exist in the Pits -- either left behind as the result of  
failed attempts to create magical items, or deliberately placed by gleeful evil  
sorcerers who enjoy a good joke when it gets you killed.  These horrible objects 
look perfectly innocent, but will detract from your character's stats or         
abilities if worn.  In most cases, you cannot remove them without breaking the   
curse first.  In fact, some are so badly cursed that even this will not work,    
and more potent methods are needed.                                              
     If you wear or wield a cursed item, you will immediately feel deathly cold, 
and the item will be marked "cursed".  On rare occasion, the item will transform 
into something truly dangerous.                                                  
     Shopkeepers will refuse to buy any item that is known to be cursed.         



<H2><A NAME="3.6X">Object Attributes</A></H2><A HREF="manual.html#3.">(return)</A>

     All combat methods other than Karate and Wrestling require equipment, and   
all benefit greatly from various qualities that your equipped items may possess. 
Defence is similarly equipment-dependent.                                        


<H3>Damage Dice and Plusses</H3>
Example 1:  A Dagger (1d4) (+6,+4)                                               

<b>Damage Dice:</b>                                                                     
     All objects have damage dice, which express how much damage they do when    
thrown.  For example, if you throw this dagger, it will do 1d4 damage (one die   
with four sides).  Melee weapons (like this one) also use their damage dice in   
hand-to-hand combat.                                                             

<b>Bonus to Skill:</b>                                                                  
     The dagger above increases melee Skill by 6.  This bonus improves your      
chance to strike a monster and the number and quality of critical hits.  Except  
for certain rare gloves, armors seldom have bonuses to Skill.  Some have small   
penalties.                                                                       

<b>Bonus to Deadliness:</b>                                                             
     The dagger above increases melee Deadliness by 4.  This increases the       
damage of every blow you land.  Except for certain rare gloves, armors seldom    
have bonuses to Deadliness.                                                      


Example 2:  a Pair of Hard Leather Boots [3, +8]                                 

<b>Bonus to Base Armor Class (AC):</b>                                                  
     All armors have bonuses to base AC.  The boots shown increase this value    
by 3.  Some weapons also have bonuses to base armor class, usually because they  
help keep monsters further away from you or parry blows.                         

<b>Bonus, Plus to Armor Class (AC):</b>                                                 
     Armor of unusually good quality or that is magical also increases your      
plus to AC.  These boots add an additional 8 to AC, giving them a total bonus of

<b>Armor Class:</b>                                                                     
     Armor Class, or AC, lessens your chances of being hit by any monster blow,  
and also reduces the pure damage hits inflict.  AC reduces cutting and stunning  
from melee attacks, and your chances of being hit by thrown physical objects     
(such as boulders or arrows).  It has no effect on magic.

<b>Stat Bonuses:</b>                                                                    
     Any kind of wearable item may affect one or more stats.  See the section on 
your character to find out more about what altering a stat does.                 

<b>Sustain Stats:</b>                                                                   
     Any kind of wearable item may sustain one or more stats.  This ensures that 
the attacks of your foes never lower that stat.                                  

<b>Stealth:</b>                                                                         
     Certain cloaks, boots, and (more rarely) other items lessen the amount of   
noise you make when moving around the dungeon.  This is very handy for avoiding  
fights and getting in the first hit.  Stealth also reduces the noise you make in 
combat, but the effect is less noticeable.                                       

<b>Awareness:</b>                                                                       
     Some rings, headgear, and various other items improve your chances to       
reveal secret doors and find traps before they find you, allow you to "hear"     
unseen monsters near to you, and make it somewhat more likely that you will      
successfully pseudo-ID objects.                                                  

<b>Infravision:</b>                                                                     
     Some headgear and (more rarely) other items increase the range at which you 
can see warm-blooded creatures, even those that would otherwise be invisible.    

<b>Tunneling:</b>                                                                       
     Some gloves and weapons allow you to dig through rock more effectively.     
All special digging tools have a bonus to tunneling.                             

<b>Speed:</b>                                                                           
     Boots, rings, and other items that hasten you are rare and powerful, for a  
fast player can perform several actions in the time it used to take to do just   
one.  Players moving at speed -10 are half as fast as normal, at +10 are twice   
as fast as normal, and at +20 are three times as fast as normal.  The maximum    
useful speed is (roughly) +35.                                                   

<b>Invisibility:</b>                                                                    
     You can become partially invisible; the greater your invisibility rating,   
the more likely it is that most monsters will move about randomly instead of     
attacking you.  This is true especially if you stay quiet and do not aggravate   
them.  Invisibility from equipment and temporary sources combine, and characters 
in and surrounded by pitch darkness are harder to see.  Many monsters, however,  
are hard to fool; the undead, invisible creatures, uniques, and hurt, nearby, or 
wary monsters are especially watchful.                                           

<b>Disarming:</b>                                                                       
     Increases your ability to disarm traps and chests and unlock doors.         

<b>Devices:</b>                                                                         
     Certain amulets and gloves improve your chance of using magical devices and 
activatable items.  Note that they do not increase damage or enhance effects;    
only increasing your Magical Device skill does that.                             

<b>Save:</b>                                                                            
     Improves your resistance to magic and various hindrance attacks.            

<b>Mana:</b>                                                                            
     Increases your mana.                                                        

<b>Light Radius:</b>                                                                    
     Pushes your light radius outwards.  Only the best light radius applies.

<b>Blows:</b>                                                                           
     Gives you extra melee blows.                                                

<b>Extra Shots:</b>                                                                     
     Rare missile launchers may allow the player to shoot more quickly than      
normal.  Each shot takes a fraction of a turn, making your target appear to move 
in slow motion.  Those skilled with bows and slings get innate extra shots.      
     The amount of time you take to fire a shot is 200 / shots.  The value for   
shots is usually 2, so a shot normally takes 100 energy (one turn).              

<b>Extra Might:</b>                                                                     
     Rare missile launchers have a greater than normal missile damage            
multiplier.  For example, a "Sling of Extra Might (x3)" multiplies damage, not   
by two like lesser slings, but by three.  The true missile weapon multiplier is  
never known for sure until the object is identified.                             

<b>Throwing:</b>                                                                        
     A number of weapons can be thrown effectively; you can determine which ones 
by 'I'nspecting them.  Such weapons get various bonuses when thrown, but         
eventually break if used in melee.                                               

<b>Perfect Balance:</b>                                                                 
     Some weapons can be thrown with unusual force, adding 50% to the amount of  
damage done (before any slay/brand bonuses) should it hit.                       

<b>Vorpal (Concussive):</b>                                                             
     Vorpal (or Concussive) weapons get lots of critical hits, and reduce the    
effect of monster resistances.                                                   

<b>Blessed:</b>                                                                         
     Blessed weapons may be used by pious characters without penalty.            

<b>Impact:</b>                                                                          
     Weapons of impact do +14 damage to rocky creatures and will often force     
opponents back.                                                                  

<b>Tunneling:</b>                                                                       
     Weapons that grant a bonus (at least +1) to tunneling do +14 damage to      
rocky creatures.                                                                 

<b>Light:</b>                                                                           
     Weapons of permanent light do +14 damage to creatures susceptible to light. 

<b>Two-handed Wield Required:</b>                                                       
     Glaives, Halberds, Quarterstaff, and all digging tools require two hands to 
wield.                                                                           

<b>Two-handed Wield Desired:</b>                                                        
     A fair number of large, powerful weapons must be wielded in two hands       
unless the player has amazing strength (normally around 18/130 - 18/160,         
depending on weapon weight).                                                     


<H3>Immunities</H3>
     If you should ever be fortunate enough to find a piece of equipment that    
grants immunity to an element, you will take no damage from that element.  Be    
warned that immunity does not extend to your backpack; the stuff you are         
carrying in inventory can still be destroyed on rare occasions.                  

<b>Immunity to Acid:</b>                                                                
     You take no damage from acid.  Worn items will not be affected by acid.     
Staffs, missiles, weapons, armor, and scrolls in your backpack become highly     
resistant to destruction.                                                        

<b>Immunity to Electricity:</b>                                                         
     You take no damage from electricity.  Rings, wands, and rods in your        
backpack become highly resistant to destruction.                                 

<b>Immunity to Cold:</b>                                                                
     You take no damage from cold.  Potions in your backpack become highly       
resistant to destruction.                                                        

<b>Immunity to Fire:</b>                                                                
     You take no damage from fire.  Spellbooks, scrolls, staffs, and burnable    
weapons, missiles, and armor in your backpack become highly resistant to         
destruction.                                                                     


<H3>Resistances</H3>
     Resistances from equipment cannot be combined; you either have it or you    
don't.                                                                           

<b>Resist Acid:</b>                                                                     
     You take one-thirds damage from acid.  Staffs, missiles, weapons, armor,    
and scrolls in your backpack become a little more resistant to destruction.      
Your equipment is attacked by acid half as often.                                

<b>Resist Electricity:</b>                                                              
     You take one-thirds damage from electricity.  Rings, wands, and rods in     
your backpack become a little more resistant to destruction.                     

<b>Resist Cold:</b>                                                                     
     You take one thirds damage from cold.  Potions in your backpack become a    
little more resistant to destruction.                                            

<b>Resist Fire:</b>                                                                     
     You take one-thirds damage from fire.  Spellbooks, scrolls, staffs, and     
burnable weapons, missiles, and armor in your backpack become a little more      
resistant to destruction.                                                        

<b>Resist Poison:</b>                                                                   
     You take one thirds damage from poison.                                     

<b>Resist Light:</b>                                                                    
     The damage you take from light is reduced.  You cannot be blinded by bright 
light.                                                                           

<b>Resist Darkness:</b>                                                                 
     The damage you take from darkness is reduced.  You cannot be blinded by     
darkness.                                                                        

<b>Resist Sound:</b>                                                                    
     The damage you take from sound is reduced.  You cannot be stunned by sound  
or by a few other kinds of distance attacks.                                     

<b>Resist Shards:</b>                                                                   
     The damage you take from blasts of shards is reduced.  You cannot be cut by 
shards.                                                                          

<b>Resist Nexus:</b>                                                                    
     The damage you take from nexus attacks is reduced.  You cannot be randomly  
teleported or altered by nexus, and will sometimes resist being warped around by 
gravity.                                                                         

<b>Resist Nether:</b>                                                                   
     The damage you take from nether is reduced.  You cannot lose experience to  
nether.                                                                          

<b>Resist Chaos:</b>                                                                    
     The damage you take from chaos is reduced, and you are immune to all the    
nasty things chaos can do to you.  This resistance does not make you resistant   
to confusion.                                                                    

<b>Resist Disenchantment:</b>                                                           
     Rarest of all the resistances, this reduces damage from disenchantment      
attacks and renders your equipment immune to disenchantment.                     

<b>Ignore acid, electricity, fire, and cold:</b>                                        
     Some objects cannot be damaged or destroyed by elemental attacks.           


<H3>Survival Attributes</H3>
<b>Resist Fear:</b>                                                                     
     Renders you fearless.                                                       

<b>Resist Blindness:</b>                                                                
     Protects you from being blinded.                                            

<b>Resist Confusion:</b>                                                                
     Makes you incapable of being confused.  Also reduces damage from blasts of  
confusion.                                                                       


<H3>Character Qualities</H3>
<b>Slow Digestion:</b>                                                                  
     Reduces your need to consume food.                                          

<b>Feather Fall:</b>                                                                    
     Renders pit traps and trap doors harmless, makes walking on lava a bit less 
dangerous, and reduces some effects of gravity and wind attacks.                 

<b>Light:</b>                                                                           
     Some weapons and helms shine with inner light.  Wearing any number of such  
objects will increase your illumination radius by one.                           

<b>Regeneration:</b>                                                                    
     Players who regenerate recover hitpoints twice as quickly as normal, and    
mana 3/2rds as quickly.  They also need to eat more.                             

<b>Telepathy (ESP):</b>                                                                 
     It is not easy to acquire this, but players who do can see intelligent      
monsters nearby.  Mindless monsters never appear, and semi-intelligent monsters  
only appear occasionally.                                                        

<b>See Invisible:</b>                                                                   
     Allows you to see and target monsters invisible to ordinary sight.          

<b>Free Action:</b>                                                                     
     Protects you from paralyzation and most slowing attacks.  Because           
paralyzation can instantly kill you, keep an eye out for this important survival 
aid.                                                                             

<b>Hold Life:</b>                                                                       
     Offers a high degree of protection from attacks (but not items) that lower  
skills.                                                                          

<b>No Fuel:</b>                                                                         
     Some light sources shine eternally.                                         


<H3>Curses and other Nastiness</H3>
<b>Soulsteal:</b>                                                                       
     Some weapons need to be fed with the blood of your foes.  If they hunger,   
and you do not feed them, they will suck away your lifeforce.                    

<b>No Magic:</b>                                                                        
     A few objects are so unmagical that you cannot cast spells while using      
them.                                                                            

<b>Random Teleportation:</b>                                                            
     Some foul rings, amulets, and boots randomly take control of your movement  
and whisk you around the dungeon.                                                

<b>Aggravate:</b>                                                                       
     Aggravation effectively reduces your stealth to nil, immediately waking up  
all monsters nearby.  Some rings and amulets possess curses that aggravate, and  
some weapons and armors are so powerful that no creature can ignore them.        

<b>Drain Exp:</b>                                                                       
     Objects that drain experience are perilous, because they slowly but surely  
erase your accumulated memories.  Of course, you can keep killing monsters to    
replace the experience which you lose.                                           

<b>Hidden Curse:</b>                                                                    
     Certain rare weapons and armor bear foul magics so well concealed that      
they only reveal themselves when you wear the item.  When activated, a hidden    
curse hideously transforms the object into something quite dangerous.            

<b>Light (ordinary) Curse:</b>                                                          
     Many wearable objects have light curses.  A scroll of Remove Curse will     
purge all ordinary curses from equipped items.                                   

<b>Heavy Curse:</b>                                                                     
     The curses on some objects are less easy to remove.  If a ordinary scroll   
of Remove Cure fails, find and read one of *Remove Curse*.                       

<b>Permanent Curse:</b>                                                                 
     There is a great and terrible Ring, seen by perhaps one character in ten    
thousand, that can never be removed once put on.                                 




<H1>Combat and Magic</H1>


<H2><A NAME="4.1X">Non-magical Combat</A></H2><A HREF="manual.html#4.">(return)</A>

     Without using magic, you may attack monsters in hand-to-hand (melee)        
combat, by using missile weapons, or by throwing objects at them.                


<H3>Quick Review (any kind of weapon)</H3>
1) Sabre (1d7)                                                                   
   1 die rolling 7.  The average damage of a die with 7 sides is 4.              
   (seven plus one, divided by two, is four).                                    

2) Gets a critical hit (an average critical hit might add two extra dice).       
   3 dice rolling 7, each with an average value of 4.                            

3) If you get special damage multipliers (from, say, your missile launcher),     
   apply to the average value of the damage dice you roll.                       

4) Roll three dice, each with an average of 4, to get an average damage of 12.   

5) Player has a Deadliness value shown on his character screen of 50%.           
   12 + 50% bonus  -->  12 + 6  -->  average damage of 18.                       

6) Finally, the special bonus for troll slaying weapons against trolls is added. 
   18 + 16 bonus  -->  average damage of 34.                                     

     Missile and throwing weapons work exactly the same way, except that the     
first benefit from a launcher multiplier and the second from a special thrown    
weapons multiplier.                                                              


<H3>Melee (weapons)</H3>
<b>Number of Blows:</b>                                                                 
     On the left side of your character screen is displayed the number of blows  
you can get per turn.  If your weapon is too heavy for you to wield properly,    
you get one blow.  Otherwise, you get between two and six blows, depending       
solely on weapon weight, Dexterity, and Strength.  It is possible for items to   
give you extra blows.                                                            

<b>Your Weapon:</b>                                                                     
     All weapons have damage dice displayed after their name (1d4, 2d5, etc.);   
they are its single most important attribute, the expression of what is like to  
wield in battle.                                                                 
     Edged weapons, pole-mounted weapons, and blunt weapons each use a separate  
skill.  You may 'I'nspect the weapon to learn what skill it uses.                

<b>Combat Skill:</b>                                                                    
     You need to have enough Skill to hit monsters regularly; do what it takes   
to keep it high.  All equipped items - other than your missile launcher and      
ammunition - can affect your melee Skill.  Many other factors can make you       
better or worse in combat, but the display on your character screen tracks       
almost all of them.                                                              

<b>Critical Hits:</b>                                                                   
     Your total combat Skill not only allows you to even hit a monster, but also 
determines how often you get critical hits.  Critical hits are vital for any     
serious fighter using any weapon, especially ones rolling few dice.  You know    
you just got a critical hit when you get any combat message other than "you hit  
the {monster name}".                                                             
     In melee, critical hits add between two and five dice; in archery or when   
using throwing weapons, they add between one and three.                          

<b>Deadliness:</b>                                                                      
     Deadliness acts as a percentage bonus to damage.  You may inspect your      
current bonus on the character screen.  High-level characters may have bonuses   
of 200% displayed on their character screens, and therefore triple the damage    
they do with the Deadliness multiplier alone.  All equipped items can affect     
your Deadliness.                                                                 

<b>Brands and Slays:</b>                                                                
     Some remarkable weapons do extra damage to various kinds of monsters; a     
Dagger of Fire, for instance, would do extra damage to creatures not immune to   
fire.  Slays, in contrast, do extra damage to particular monster races, so wield 
that Mace of Orc Slaying if you come upon any orcs.  Only the best applicable    
quality is used; they do not combine.                                            
     Bonuses from slays and brands are applied after all other damage            
adjustments, except monster resistances.  Being more skilled with the weapon you 
wield increases the effect of the brand.                                         


<H3>Melee (unarmed)</H3>
<b>Unarmed Combat:</b>                                                                  
     The unarmed combat methods, Karate and Wrestling, are known as martial      
arts.  When using a martial art, you gain additional blows as you increase       
your skill in the martial art.                                                   
     They are effective against almost all sorts of monsters, are relatively     
inexpensive to learn, and really come into their own against monsters that seem  
to resist everything.  But be warned!  You need to be blessed (Scrolls of        
Blessing work) to do damage to non-material beings, and touching certain kinds   
of monsters can be quite painful...                                              
     You can get (temporary) slays and brands with martial arts, or you can use  
the brand offered by some rare gauntlets.  You can also get critical hits on     
occasion, especially if you have skill in Piety, Blood Dominion, or Nature Lore, 
 or get vorpal blows or sneak attacks.  Bonuses (and penalties) to Skill from    
non-weapon equipment count when using martial arts, but bonuses to Deadliness do 
not.                                                                             

<b>Damage Display:</b>                                                                  
     The melee section of your character screen changes when you use a martial   
art.  Instead of displaying Skill and Deadliness, it shows the approximate       
average damage you did with your last ten or twenty hits.  If your skill,        
strength, or dexterity change significantly, you have to engage in combat to get 
more accurate figures.                                                           

<b>The Martial Arts:</b>                                                                
     Wrestling depends on your skill and strength.  Raise both high enough, and  
you can do a large amount of pure damage.  Wrestlers can often throw or tackle   
their foes, robbing them of energy (and thus effectively slowing them down).     
     Karate depends on skill, dexterity, and (to a lesser degree) strength.      
While it doesn't do as much direct damage as wrestling, no other combat method   
can hinder your foes quite as much.  Given enough skill, you can stun, slow, or  
confuse your foes - and a hindered monster may soon enough be a dead one.        

<b>Special abilities:</b>                                                               
     Most scrolls, potions, spells, or talents that grant extra powers or        
abilities to melee are fully effective when used with martial arts.              


<H3>Shooting</H3>
     Ranged fire with missile launchers is a non-magical method of doing damage  
at a safe distance.                                                              

<b>Setting up to Shoot:</b>                                                             
     Slings shoot shots and seeker shots, bows shoot arrows and seeker arrows,   
and crossbows shoot bolts and seeker bolts.  Simply equip the weapon and keep    
plenty of ammunition to hand.                                                    

<b>The Quiver Slots:</b>                                                                
     Ammo is best kept in special quiver slots.  You may "wield" up to ten       
different piles of ammo, then fire them just as you would those in the backpack. 
Ammo in the quiver will use space in your backpack.                              

<b>Shooting:</b>                                                                        
     You shoot at a monster by typing 'f' (or 't' in the rogue-like command      
set), then selecting a missile you would like to fire.  This activates the       
targeting interface described in the section on commands.                        

<b>Number of Shots:</b>                                                                 
     On the right side of your character screen is displayed the number of shots 
you can get per turn.  The number of shots depends on skill, plus any bonus      
shots that the weapon provides.  Extra shots are not fired all at once; instead, 
each shot takes less time, making monsters appear to move in slow motion.        

<b>Your Launcher:</b>                                                                   
     All launchers have a multiplier to damage:  for example, a Longbow (x3)     
would multiply the normal damage of the ammo it fires by three.  This multiplier 
is applied before the brand/slay bonus and after everything else.                

<b>Brands and Slays:</b>                                                                
     Ammunition occasionally possesses the same kinds of slays and brands found  
on melee weapons.  Missile launchers are also capable of imparting slays and     
brands.                                                                          


<H3>Throwing</H3>
     Throwing objects requires less skill than using missile weapons, and can be 
an important combat method.  For novice adventurers, throwing flasks of oil and  
boulders can be a life-saver, and there are rumours of objects deep in the       
dungeon that can do large amounts of damage when thrown.  All objects have       
damage dice, but most do not display them.  If you think an object should do     
nasty things to your foes, it's certainly worth trying to throw it at them, just 
to see if anything happens.                                                      

<b>Getting ready to throw:</b>                                                          
     To throw an object, you use the 'v' command and select any item in your     
backpack, on your person, or on the floor.  This activates the targeting         
interface described in the section on commands.                                  

<b>Number of throws:</b>                                                                
     You may never throw more than one item per turn.                            

<b>Hitting more often:</b>                                                              
     Get close to what you're aiming at, especially when your skill is           
relatively low.  Improve your throwing skill, and wear things (rings, for        
example) that increase your overall combat Skill.                                

<b>Special throwing weapons:</b>                                                        
     A boulder with damage dice of 10d9 does an average of 50 damage.  It gets   
no Deadliness bonuses from equipment, no slays or brands, and cannot get         
critical hits.                                                                   
     However, special throwing weapons (weapons like throwing knives and         
javelins that are designed for throwing), get the following advantages:          
- They benefit from all Deadliness bonuses other than those granted by your      
melee and missile weapons.                                                       
- They may have slays or brands.                                                 
- They not infrequently get critical hits.                                       
- They get a special damage multiplier.  This ranges from 2 to 10, depending     
  on throwing skill and whether you are a specialist spellcaster, a specialist   
  warrior, or anyone else.  Perfectly balanced weapons (marked "well-balanced")  
  increase this multiplier by 50%.                                               
- They seldom break when thrown (just be careful not to use them in melee).      

<b>Potions:</b>                                                                         
     Another way to make good use of a high throwing skill is to hurl potions at 
your foes.  The damage they do (or the power they have) depends on potion type   
and your throwing skill.                                                         



<H3>Getting good at combat</H3>
     Non-magical combat can be very powerful, but only if you work at it.  You   
increase the damage you do by:                                                   

1) Raising your base damage dice.  Increasing the number of dice both adds       
damage and makes the attack more reliable (because the damage done is more       
likely to be close to the average).  Increasing dice sides adds damage without   
affecting reliability.                                                           

2) Increasing your total combat Skill.  This may mean                            
- increasing your melee or missile skills,                                       
- getting better plusses to Skill from equipment,                                
- wielding a lighter weapon,                                                     
- choosing a weapon that your race prefers, or                                   
- using spells and objects that temporarily enhance your abilities.              
     This last can make all the difference when fighting tough monsters.         

3) Getting more critical hits.  Critical hits are important; the fewer base dice 
your weapon or ammo has, the more important they are.  It is possible to double  
the average damage you do with critical hits alone.  You can get more criticals  
by:                                                                              
- raising your total Skill,                                                      
- attacking sleeping monsters (especially if you are sneaking),                  
- increasing your piety, nature lore, or blood dominion skills, or               
- wielding vorpal weapons.                                                       

4) Increasing your Deadliness.  Deadliness may not seem powerful at first, but   
it can eventually triple the damage you do on every blow.  Once you get your     
base damage and critical hits up high enough, Deadliness can make you            
formidable.                                                                      

5) Having the right slay or brand for the job.  If you're serious about melee,   
have more than one weapon on hand.  Also, watch out for monsters that resist     
either edged or blunt weapons (virtually no monster resists both).               

6) Taking the Oath of Iron.  The advantages include:                             
- better bonuses to missile weapon multiplier and shooting speed.                
- better thrown weapon multiplier.                                               
- better critical hit bonuses from piety, nature lore, and blood dominion.       
- better wrestling and karate damage.                                            
- heavy weapons are much easier to handle.                                       
- no limits to combat-related skill increases.                                   


<H3>Winning "unwinnable" fights</H3>
     Some monsters are simply too tough to just clobber; fortunately, there are  
scrolls, potions, mushrooms, and magical devices that can turn a losing battle   
into a major victory.  If your enemies seem too tough to kill now, maybe they    
won't be after you've enhanced yourself, hindered them, and chosen the right     
battlefield.                                                                     


<H3>Details</H3>
<b>Monster Susceptibilities:</b>                                                        
- Susceptible to fire                                                            
     Bonus to damage of fire brand is increased by 50%.

     Bonus to damage of frost brand is increased by 50%.                         

<b>Monster Resistances:</b>                                                             
- Resistant to edged weapons (common to rocky, bony, and metallic monsters)      
     Swords, polearms, arrows, and bolts do no damage on almost 2/3rds of hits.  
- Almost immune to edged weapons (common to rocky and metallic monsters)         
     Swords, polearms, arrows, and bolts do no damage on about 5/6ths of hits.   
- Resistant to blunt weapons (common among incorporeal beings)                   
     Hafted weapons and sling shots do no damage on almost 2/3rds of hits.       
- Almost immune to blunt weapons (common among incorporeal beings)               
     Hafted weapons and sling shots do no damage on about 5/6ths of hits.        

Vorpal/piercing and concussive weapons reduce the effect of the above monster    
resistances.                                                                     


<b>Noise-making:</b>                                                                    
     Combat is noisy.  The stealthier your are, and the higher your burglary     
skill, the less extra noise you make.                                            

<b>Wielding two weapons:</b>                                                            
     You can wield two weapons of the same type (edged, blunt, or pole-mounted   
weapons), as long as both require only one hand to wield and, together, they are 
relatively light (depends on your strength).  When wielding two weapons, your    
total Skill drops significantly (depending on total weapon weight).              
     If you wield two weapons, you get one chance to hit with each weapon.  For  
each blow, you first attempt to hit with your primary weapon (the one held in    
your sword arm) and, if that misses, your secondary weapon.  If one weapon runs  
out of blows, you continue with the other until it, too, has expended them all.  
Your total number of blows does not increase.  Your digging ability is the       
better of that granted by either weapon.                                         
     Wielding two weapons is particularly helpful against evasive creatures, and 
against those who resist edged or blunt weapons.                                 

<b>Special shield bonuses:</b>                                                          
     Most melee weapons fit comfortably in one hand, keeping your shield arm     
free.  If you have a shield on your arm, you can automatically take advantage of 
opportunities to bash, gain a significant amount of standard protection (shields 
have a high base armor class), and sometimes even deflect non-magical missiles   
or partially protect against shards.                                             

<b>Shield bashes:</b>                                                                   
     When fighting hand-to-hand, you will occasionally get in a shield bash if   
you are wearing a shield on your arm.  The frequency of shield bashes depends on 
dexterity, melee combat skill, and the level of monster you are fighting.        
Characters with no magic realm get in more shield bashes, as will those who do   
little damage in melee otherwise.  The effectiveness of shield bashes depends    
mostly on shield size and weight, with a bonus for strength.  When you bash a    
monster, you will inflict damage, and possibly stunning or even confusion.  You  
may also stumble, and lose normal melee blows.                                   

<b>Two-handed weapons:</b>                                                              
     Some weapons require two hands (but many of these can be wielded in one     
hand by very strong players).  Any shield worn is transferred to your back.      
This negates base armor protection and removes the special shield abilities      
described above, but has no effect on magical protection, resistances, or other  
attributes.                                                                      

<b>Ranged fire inaccuracy:</b>                                                          
     Distance from the target has a significant effect on the accuracy of ranged 
fire and throwing.  You may need to get quite close to hit tough monsters,       
especially if your skill is relatively low.  Inaccuracy and obstructions can     
make aiming into diagonal slits (and in some cases around multiple sharp         
corners) very difficult.  Firing out of a slit yourself, however, is             
advantageous.                                                                    

<b>Special Notes:</b>                                                                   
     In order to attack a creature that you can't see in a wall or door, you     
must issue the Tunnel or alter adjacent grid command.                            



<H2><A NAME="4.2X">Burglary</A></H2><A HREF="manual.html#4.">(return)</A>

     Various special burglary actions can be used by typing the '+' (alter) key, 
and then moving towards a monster (to steal), a passable grid (to set a trap),   
or a door (to lock it).  Burglars cannot use most of these abilities when        
shapeshifted.                                                                    

<b>Stealing  (requires a skill of 4):</b>                                               
     All monsters that yield items or gold when killed may also be a source of   
similar loot to thieves.   The most lucrative targets are those monsters that    
drop good or even excellent treasure, but they tend also to be unusually         
difficult to steal from.  Increasing your Burglary skill, choosing sleeping      
monsters, moving in darkness, becoming more dextrous, and finding ways to become 
invisible will all improve your chances.  Stealing soon after your previous      
attempt, stealing from thieves, or from wary monsters will all reduce your       
chances.                                                                         
     There are few things more satisfying than making off with some arrogant     
wizard's hat.  But theft is not all fun and games.  Every time you steal, the    
monsters get warier.  Steal too often in a short period of time, and you may     
very quickly get hunted down.                                                    

<b>Locking doors  (requires a skill of 7):</b>                                          
     Burglars may lock closed doors; locking a door makes it more difficult for  
monsters to open.  The power of the lock increases with skill.                   


<H3>Monster Traps</H3>
<b>Trap-setting  (requires a skill of 10):</b>                                          
     Of all the many things that only burglars can do, setting traps is the most 
important.  Depending on your burglary skill, you may have between one and six   
traps active at any one time.  It takes three turns to set up a trap (this is    
normally automatic but, if disturbed, you'll have to issue the command a few     
times).                                                                          
     You then load the trap with one or more objects by typing '+', and moving   
towards an existing monster trap.  Traps may be loaded with melee weapons,       
missile weapons, potions, scrolls, wands, staffs, rods, or anything that can be  
thrown.  You can only load the trap with one kind of object; the two exceptions  
to this are that you need to supply a missile weapon with suitable ammunition,   
and that you can pack in boulders to your heart's content.                       
     The damage traps do depends on your burglary skill and on the objects you   
use.  A skilled burglar can make traps which use magical devices that he cannot  
understand, wield weapons that he cannot lift, and fire missiles with deadly     
accuracy regardless of combat skill.                                             

<b>Monsters and Traps:</b>                                                              
     A trap is like getting a free chance to do damage without being in harm's   
way.  The damage of most items other than scrolls and ordinary thrown objects    
varies depending on burglary skill.                                              
     Whenever a monster enters the grid containing the trap, several things can  
happen.  Firstly, ghosts and evasive monsters get a (large) chance to ignore the 
trap entirely.  Secondly, smart monsters get a chance to disarm the trap, and    
all non-ghostly monsters get a chance to smash it.  If the trap is neither       
avoided nor destroyed, it goes off.  Monsters become wary of traps if they see   
one activate; you are well advised to place them in the darkness.                
     A single non-perfectly balanced weapon will get melee blows, a missile      
launcher will fire one or more shots, a potion will smash, a scroll will be      
read, a charged wand, staff, or rod will activate, and anything else will be     
thrown.                                                                          
     Most weapon attributes (Skill, Deadliness, multipliers, slays, brands, and  
number of blows or shots, but not critical hits) are treated much as they are in 
normal combat.  Traps are great ways to use powerful weapons that you have no    
training for; a Mace of Burning can do real damage!                              


<H3>Burglars and Combat</H3>
<b>Light Weapons, Sneak Attacks, and Backstabs:</b>                                     
     Burglars are better with light weapons than anyone else.  With them, they   
can get quite significant bonuses to combat Skill.  Conversely, their penalty    
for heavy weapons goes up with skill until it is twice the normal amount.        
Martial arts are unaffected.  Your character screen display takes all of this    
into account.                                                                    
     Burglars get extra bonuses against sleeping monsters.  If they go into      
sneaking mode and melee a sleeping monster, they may sometimes be able to land   
sneak attacks, which act as unusually powerful critical hits.  Note:  You cannot 
sneak-attack a monster, then use a wand of sleep monster on it, then sneak       
attack it again.                                                                 
     Burglars can also backstab fleeing opponents (this acts as a general        
increase to hit chance).                                                         


<H3>Sneaking in the Dark</H3>
     Most characters have trouble exploring in the dark, as they need light to   
find objects, see monsters, and know where the walls are before bumping into     
them.  However, alternative solutions exist to all of these problems.  If you    
raise your Burglary, Perception, and Stealth skills high enough to get access to 
the "Detect and Nab Objects", "Sense Area", and "Sneaking" talents, and your     
Disarming skill higher than the current dungeon level, your only remaining       
problem will be monsters.  While no certain method is available for spotting     
monsters without light, characters with good Perception and Stealth skills can   
"sense" and "hear" most of the monsters in a totally darkened room.  Guild-      
Burglars have an advantage here.                                                 
     Although sneaking in the dark can be very dangerous (you can't read a       
scroll of Teleport, for example), a character skilled at Stealth becomes much    
quieter, and a character skilled in Burglary is more deadly in combat, better at 
theft, and a much better dodger, especially if he is both in and surrounded by   
darkness.  All characters take only 2/3rds damage from magic and missiles if in  
and surrounded by darkness.

<b>Healing:</b>                                                                         
     If your hitpoints drop below zero, you die.  Always have something to       
quickly restore them.                                                            

<b>Escaping:</b>                                                                        
     A trapped adventurer is a dead adventurer.  Always have a way to get out of 
trouble.                                                                         

<b>Detecting:</b>                                                                       
     The best defence is being prepared.  Know your enemies, and know where they 
are.                                                                             

<b>Defending against pure damage:</b>                                                   
     Your armor class (AC) reduces the chance that most kinds of melee attacks   
(except gazing and stealing) will hit you.  It reduces the pure damage inflicted 
by most melee attacks (acid, electricity, fire, frost, and poison attacks being  
the exceptions), and makes it less likely that they will stun or cut you.  It    
also protects against shots, arrows, bolts, boulders, missiles, and certain      
kinds of traps, but not against magic.                                           
      Each piece of armor has a base AC value and possibly also a magical bonus. 
Add the two together, and you have the total protective value of the item.  For  
example, a Chain Mail (-3) [14, +6] increases your AC by 20.  Note the "(-3)".   
It is a (small) penalty to melee Skill; heavy armor restricts your movement      
slightly.                                                                        
     Special note:  shields worn on the back have a base AC value of zero.       

<b>Cuts, poison, and stunning:</b>                                                      
     Many monsters can inflict special kinds of physical damage on you, such as  
opening wounds, poisoning, or stunning.  After you start earning a little money, 
plow some of it back into potions or mushrooms of cure wounds, and keep them     
handy at all times.  If a monster manages to heavily stun you, get away fast!    

<b>Character-hindrance:</b>                                                             
     There are many monsters capable of casting spells to blind, confuse, slow,  
and paralyze you, plus quite a few other nasty tricks not mentioned here.  Free  
Action eventually becomes critical to your survival and you should keep stuff    
that fixes blindness and confusion on hand.  Your Saving Throw protects against  
these and other attacks.                                                         

<b>Elemental and magical attacks:</b>                                                   
     Acid, Electricity, Fire, and Cold are the basic elements; many monsters use 
them.  Because the maximum damage they can do to you is very high, becoming      
resistant is important.  Unlike with other attack types, you can resist, double  
resist, and be immune to the elements.  Double resistance is the combination of  
a permanent resistance (from equipment) and a temporary one (from a spell).      
Temporary resistances are also known as oppositions.  Immunity to any of the     
elements is hard to get.                                                         
     Poison is deadly and not so easy to resist.  You can double-resist (resist  
and oppose) poison.                                                              
     There are many kinds of magical attacks; most can be resisted, some can     
not.  Those capable of doing the most damage are darkness, chaos, and nether.    

     For more detail, see the section on object attributes.                      

<b>Reductions of Experience and Stats:</b>                                              
     Even when your character is starting out, there are rare traps and monsters 
capable of lowering his stats and attacking his skills.  In addition, a strong,  
unresisted elemental attack can occasionally lower a stat.  Slowly, these        
dangers increase until it becomes very important that you find objects that      
provide hold life and sustain at least your critical stats.                      

<b>Theft:</b>                                                                           
     Nobody is more annoying than a thief.  You've just found that cool          
spellbook or nifty weapon and now it's gone.  You can gain a significant degree  
of protection from theft by increasing your dodging skill and your dexterity,    
and can always collect your stuff from the thief's corpse.  Unfortunately,       
thieves are smart enough to stash away the money they take from you.             

<b>Rumours:</b>                                                                         
     It is rumoured that certain undead possess a very deadly touch...           
     The same rumours whisper that Athelas has remarkable curative properties...

<H3>The Four Realms of Magic</H3>
<b>Wizardry:</b>                                                                        
     Wizardry is the magic of power:  the power of the elements, of chaos and    
confusion, of nexus and planar travel, and of pure mana.  Wizards can befuddle   
their enemies, vanish into thin air, and wield all sorts of esoteric powers.     
Wizardry can be tricky to use, however; miscast spells can unleash all sorts of  
wild magic.                                                                      
     Special realm skill:  Wizardry                                              

<b>Piety:</b>                                                                           
     Piety is the channeling of divine force; those allied to Heaven have        
extraordinary powers to heal and Judge.  They wield light against the darkness   
of evil, the darkness of ignorance, the darkness of the hidden and unknown.  The 
pious can dispel and banish, wield holy fire, and expose the very minds of their 
enemies to the untrammeled might of God.                                         
     Pious characters can only wield blunt (hafted) and blessed melee weapons    
effectively.  If they chose to wield any other kind of weapon, they get a        
penalty to melee skill, a reduced light radius, and their prayers are more       
likely to fail.                                                                  
     Special realm skill:  Holy Alliance                                         

<b>Druidic Lore:</b>                                                                    
     Druids and druids alone understand the lore of nature; the earth, the sea,  
and the sky are at their beck and call.  They wield the elements like no other   
magic-user can, and alter the weather itself to enhance their powers.  Druids    
may shapeshift into many marvelous forms, wither their foes, and have powers to  
heal and recover second only to the pious.                                       
     Special realm skill:  Nature Lore                                           
     See the sections on weather and shapeshifting below.                        

<b>Necromancy:</b>                                                                      
     Black hexes and red blood, foul rituals:  dread, terrible necromancy.       
Users of the Dark Arts wield night, nether, life-draining and dispelling, pure   
mana, poison, and mental powers to crush all who stand against them, and can     
ritually enhance their powers to achieve horrific strength.  Great in power      
although necromancy is, it can be very dangerous when cast incautiously.  A      
necromancer is well advised to pay attention to his saving throw.                
     Special realm skill:  Blood Dominion                                        
     See the section on shapeshifting below.                                     


<H3>Spellcasting</H3>
     The magics of the major realms are found in books, seven for each realm.    
Three are readily available in stores, the other four are harder to find.        

<b>Getting spell information:</b>                                                       
      You may browse books of your realm.  When browsing, you may get more       
information about individual spells that are not too high-level by pressing      
their letter.  Spells that you have cast successfully will display any power or  
damage information.  This information usually updates to reflect temporary       
conditions (weather being the major exception), so you get up-to-date            
information on the approximate current power of your spells.                     
     Be aware that the true usefulness of some spells only becomes apparent with 
much experimentation.                                                            

<b>Gaining new spells:</b>                                                              
     You do not need to learn new spells.  You may cast any available spell.     

<b>Casting spells:</b>                                                                  
     You may cast any learnt spell that has a spell level less than or equal to  
your Spellcasting skill.                                                         
     You cast spells by typing 'm' or 'p', choosing a spellbook, and then a      
spell.  If you don't have enough mana to cast that spell, the failure chance is  
increased, you may lose a point of constitution, and you may faint dead away     
(especially if you didn't have nearly enough mana).  Having chosen a spell, you  
then try to cast it.  Failing means that priests and druids just lose their turn 
(and their mana), but wizards may unleash wild magic and necromancers get        
attacked by the dark forces they failed to bind.                                 

<b>Mana:</b>                                                                            
     Your mana depends on your magic power skill and your spell stat.  All       
spellcasters lose a percentage (not a fixed amount) of mana for wearing heavy    
armor; specialist spellcasters are most affected.  You can reduce this penalty   
by increasing your dodging skill.                                                

<b>Spell failure chance:</b>                                                            
     Your spell failure chance depends on the spell itself (some spells are      
inherently hard to cast), the minimum skill required to cast the spell, your     
spell stat, and your special magic-user skill.  Your special magic-user skill    
also has an important effect on the reliability of many spells.                  
     Those using wizardry or necromancy suffer if they wear gloves that do not   
provide free action, increase dexterity, or enhance magic mastery skill.         
Priests suffer likewise if they wield an unblessed edged weapon.  Stunning       
(especially if heavy), fear, and lack of mana all make magic harder to use.      
     Priests and Necromancers can cast spells in the dark, though both suffer
an increase in spell failure.  Priestly spells will decrease in potency, and     
necromatic spells will increase in potency.                                      

<b>Weather:</b>                                                                         
     The knowledge of weather is an art, not a science.  However, it is believed 
that values for wind, temperature, and humidity are generally near average with  
only occasional extremes.  It is also rumoured that each of these three          
components of weather affect two kinds of druidic magic; one benefits from low   
values, another benefits from high ones.  In contrast, attempting to use         
techniques in unfavorable weather works poorly, if at all.                       
     Druids have a talent that allows them to forecast the weather.  Weather     
forecasting becomes more accurate with Nature Lore skill, and less accurate as   
you travel further below the surface.                                            

<b>Shapeshifting:</b>                                                                   
     There are two kinds of shapechanges.  Druids (and necromancers) can take on 
the form of various creatures for as long as they like.  Certain other magics    
and elixirs can also change your shape, but their effects last only for a short  
time.                                                                            
     In all cases, you can return to your normal form by typing ']'.  You lose a 
third of your mana whenever not in your normal form, and your magical device     
skill usually drops, but you often gain some infravision.  Various effects can   
be checked by using the Character screen.                                        
  Goat    : Slow digestion, can eat almost anything safely.                      
  Bear    : Hard hitter, tough and strong.                                       
  Mouse   : Weak, but incredibly stealthy.  Never aggravates.  Perceptive.       
  Hound   : Telepathy.                                                           
  Cheetah : Fast and dexterous but not very strong.                              
  Lion    : No fear, excellent bare-clawed fighter.                              
  Dragon  : Good fighter, bonuses to various stats.  Can breath using essences.  
  Ent     : Strong, wise, resist poison and cold, free action, see invis, great  
            at tunneling.  Cannot have feather fall, cannot be immune to or      
            resist fire, lousy dexterity.                                        
  Troll   : Extreme regeneration and toughness.  Dumb.  No feather fall.         
  Bat     : Fast but weak.  Infravision, feather fall, and resist blindness.     
  Lich    : Fast, invisible, strong versus cold, poison, but hit hard by fire.   
  Vampire : Strong, smart, fast, with a safe lifeforce.                          
            Extra damage from light, less from dark.                             
  Werewolf: Strong, hale, and fearless.  Good bare-clawed fighter.               
  Serpent : Strong, stealthy, and great at wrestling.                            
  Angel   : Wise and strong and imbued with light.                               
  Golem   : Strong against magic, but blocked from it.                           
  Eagle   : Swift and silent, but weak of attack.                                
  Fire Vortex: Wreathed in fire, and protected from it.                          

<H3>Getting Good at Magic</H3>
1)   Take a spellcaster's Oath to tap the full power of a realm.  You take an    
Oath by selecting the special realm skill in the skills screen, and typing '*'.  

2)   Use the right magic for the monster.  Most combat spells are resisted by    
some monster races; some actually do extra damage against certain foes.          

3)   Use spells in the right tactical settings.  Many magics only reveal their   
true usefulness in particular environments; these often differ greatly from      
those that may be familiar to you from other games of this type.                 

4)  Be aware of special conditions.  Druidic magic relies heavily on the         
weather; if conditions are sufficiently adverse, natural magic just fizzles out. 
Wizards, Priests, and Necromancers all also have magic that works best when cast 
repeatedly, or when other spells are cast previously, or when a lot of light     
exists nearby.  The spell comments will mention such matters.                    

5)  Test unfamiliar spells.  All attack and hindrance magics are known to be     
effective, but the best way to use them may not be easy to discover.  In         
general, the more random or resist-able the spell, the more powerful it can be   
when used appropriately.                                                         


<H3>Spell Projection Types</H3>
     The names of spells and magical devices sometimes give you information      
about what areas they affect and what shapes they take.                          

"Bolt", "Missile"                                                                
     Fires a magical bolt in a direction or at your chosen target.  Are stopped  
by the first monster or wall in their way; monsters in walls take full damage.   
Some also "Beam" upon occasion.                                                  

"Beam", "Spear", "Lance", "Line", "Spark"                                        
     Fires a beam of magic in the direction you choose, or towards your target.  
They are quite useful because they do full damage to every monster in a straight 
line.  Wands and Rods of Light work this way.  A few beam spells ("spark") have  
short ranges.                                                                    

"Arc", "Cone", "Breath"                                                          
     Fires an arc, centered in the direction of the target.  These are           
relatively short-range spells, because arcs lose energy as they expand.          
Monsters in walls take no damage.  All monster breaths are arcs.                 

"Ball", "Storm"  (storms have a larger radius)                                   
     If you target a specific monster, such spells explode centered at that      
location.  Otherwise, they travel in the direction you choose, and explode as    
soon they hit a monster or wall, or reach their maximum range.  Monsters in      
walls take no damage.  These spells only do full damage to the single grid at    
the center of the explosion, but can affect monsters that can't see you.  Many   
monster spells are balls.                                                        

"Orb", "Sphere"                                                                  
     Orbs are ball spells that do full damage to every grid they affect, and     
usually have small explosions.                                                   

"Dispel", "Confuse/Slow/Frighten/etc. Monsters"                                  
     A fair number of spells affect all monsters in line of sight (no walls,     
rubble, or trees between you and them, up to a range of 20).                     

{various}                                                                        
     Ball spells that center on you do full damage to all adjacent grids.  Ball  
spells can take the form of starburst explosions; they do full damage to all     
grids they affect, but are less likely to hit grids further away from the        
center.                                                                          
     There are also many different kinds of special projections, such as walls   
of fire, beam storms, seeking vortexes, lingering clouds, and so on.             

<b>Special notes:</b>                                                                   
     Monsters that you cannot see take half damage from magic, for the same      
reasons that make non-magical combat less effective against them.  Monsters that 
are only partially visible take two-thirds damage from magic.                    


<H3>Hindering your foes</H3>
     If it looks too tough to kill, perhaps you can knock it down a bit.  There  
are few monsters that cannot be hindered in some way if you work hard enough at  
it.                                                                              

<b> Sleep:</b>                                                                          
     Sleeping monsters can't hurt you - until they wake up again.                
<b> Slow:</b>                                                                           
     If you can slow a monster, you are well on the way to killing it.           
     Slowed monsters eventually return to normal speed.                          
<b> Stun:</b>                                                                           
     Bashing, strong electrical attacks, and some other things can stun          
     monsters, reducing their spellcasting and melee ability.                    
<b> Confuse:</b>                                                                        
     Monsters may be confused by bright light (blinding), confusion attacks,     
     or spells of confuse monster.  They move randomly about and cannot cast     
     any spells until the effects wear off.                                      
<b> Fear:</b>                                                                           
     Most monsters can be frightened.  Those that are will attempt to teleport   
     away (if they have such a spell) or run.  Monsters slower than you will     
     charge and go down fighting if nearby.                                      
<b> Mana:</b>                                                                           
     Wait for the monster to run out of mana; most monsters have a limited       
     amount of mana.  It may take a long time for them to run out, but once      
     they do, they'll need a while to recover.  Be aware that some monsters      
     can magically recover mana.                                                 


<H3>Magical Devices</H3>
     Wands, staffs, and rods are an important part of many adventurers'          
arsenals, and some specialize in their use.  In addition to these items, certain 
rare rings and amulets can be 'A'ctivated and there are rumours of weapons and   
armor with extraordinary powers.                                                 
     If you depend on magical devices much, it is important to have a high       
enough magical device skill.  This applies especially to magical devices that    
hinder monsters.                                                                 

<b>Getting exact damage information:</b>                                                
     If you use magical devices often enough, you will eventually get the        
message "you feel you know more about...".  'I'nspect the object, and you may    
very well see extra numerical information about damage, etc.  This takes a lot   
of the guesswork out of using staffs, wands, and rods to fight your battles.     

<b>Recharging:</b>                                                                      
     Wands and staffs have to be recharged every so often.  The failure rate of  
recharging depends on item type (wands are more fragile than staffs), item       
level, your magical device skill, and the power of the recharging spell you are  
using.  A high magical device skill makes magical recharging much safer.         




<H1>Interacting with the Game</H1>

<H2><A NAME="5.1X">List of commands</A></H2><A HREF="manual.html#5.">(return)</A>

     This game supports two different command sets:  Original and Roguelike.     
The original keyset takes advantage of the number pad and frees up more space    
for macros on a regular keyboard.  If you lack a numberpad, however, the         
roguelike keyset is likely to be the better choice.

<b>Canceling a Command:</b>                                                             
     Virtually all commands can be canceled at any point before execution by     
hitting the ESC key.                                                             

<b>Command Counts:</b>                                                                  
     Any command that can be repeated, or that can manipulate more than one      
object, can take a count.  By default, most that do are automatically given a    
count of 99.  Although most commands that usually need a quantity will ask for   
one, for other commands a quantity is only sometimes desired.  Hence command     
counts.  For example, to tunnel into a wall exactly 50 times, you would type a   
zero ("0"), then "50", followed by a return.  Then use the tunnel command.  All  
commands that use quantities will stop if you are disturbed, accomplish your     
intended task, hit any key, or when the count expires.                           

<b>Doing More with Less Effort:</b>                                                     
     The section on making macros describes how to:                              
- quickly switch to a shovel or backup weapon,                                   
- fire a missile or cast commonly used spells with a single keystroke,           
- prevent accidental use of valuable equipment,                                  
- and many other things                                                          

<b>Interfaces:</b>                                                                      
     See the "interfaces" section for more details about powerful and complex    
commands.                                                                        



<H2><A NAME="5.3X">Command Descriptions</A></H2><A HREF="manual.html#5.">(return)</A>

     Command names are followed by one or two characters:  The first is that     
used in the original keyset; the second, that used in the roguelike keyset (if   
different).                                                                      

<H3>Object commands</H3>
<b>Inventory list (i) :</b>                                                             
     Display a list of objects in your backpack.                                 

<b>Equipment list (e) :</b>                                                             
     Display a list of objects you are currently wielding, wearing, carrying in  
your quiver, or otherwise have immediately to hand.                              

<b>Drop an item (d) :</b>                                                               
     Drop an item from your inventory or equipment onto the floor.  If the grid  
you are standing on has 20 objects already, or cannot hold objects, the object   
will wind up nearby.  This command takes half a turn.                            

<b>Destroy an item (k) / (Ctrl-D) :</b>                                                 
     Destroy an object in your inventory or on the dungeon floor.  If the        
"verify destroy" option is ON, you must verify this command.  This command takes 
a full turn.                                                                     

<b>Wear/Wield equipment (w) :</b>                                                       
     Wear or wield an object in your inventory or from the floor.  Since only    
one object can be in each slot at a time, if you wear or wield an item into a    
slot that is already occupied, the old item will first be taken off.  If there   
is no room in your inventory, it drops to the floor.  This command takes a full  
turn.                                                                            

<b>Take off equipment (t) / (T) :</b>                                                   
     Take off a (uncursed) piece of equipment and return it to your inventory.   
If there is no room in your inventory for the item, your pack will overflow and  
you will drop the item after taking it off.  This command takes half a turn.     

<b>Switch primary and secondary weapon (X) :</b>                                        
     Exchange whatever weapon you have wielded with the first weapon in your     
inventory inscribed {@0} or {@w0}.  This is very handy for swapping in and out   
shovels.  This command takes a full turn.                                        


<H3>Movement Commands</H3>
<b>Stay still -- with normal pickup (,) / (.) :</b>                                     
     Stay in the same square for one move.  If you normally pick up objects you  
encounter, you will pick up whatever you are standing on.  You may also use the  
"5" key (both keysets).  This command takes a full turn.                         

<b>Walk -- with normal pickup (;) :</b>                                                 
     This command activates every time you press a direction key; it moves you   
one step in the given direction.  This command takes a full turn.                

<b>Walk -- flip pickup (-) :</b>                                                        
     Walk.  If you normally pick things up, don't.  Otherwise, do.  This command 
takes a full turn.                                                               

<b>Run (.) / (,) :</b>                                                                  
     This command is very useful for rapid dungeon exploration.  It will move    
you in the given direction, following any bends in the corridor, until you       
either have to make a choice between two directions or are disturbed.  Most      
players run by holding down Shift and pressing a direction key.                  

<b>Go up staircase (<) :</b>                                                            
     Ascends an up staircase.  Going up a staircase will take you to a new       
dungeon level unless you are at 50 feet (level 1), in which case you will return 
to the town.  This command takes a full turn.                                    

<b>Go down staircase (>) :</b>                                                          
     Descends a down staircase.  Going down a staircase will take you to a new   
dungeon level.  This command takes a full turn.                                  


<H3>Special Action Commands</H3>
<b>Get objects (g) :</b>                                                                
     Pick up objects and gold on the floor beneath you.  Picking up gold takes   
no time, and objects take 1/10th of a normal turn each (maximum time cost is a   
full turn).  You may pick up objects until the floor is empty or your backpack   
is full.                                                                         

<b>Rest (R) :</b>                                                                       
     You recover from wounds twice as quickly by resting than by repeatedly      
staying still.  This command can be told to stop automatically after a certain   
amount of time, or when various conditions are met.  In either case, you always  
wake up when anything disturbs you, or when you press any key.                   
     After typing 'R', use "*" to rest until your hitpoints and mana are         
restored, and "&" to rest until you are fully "healed".  This command may accept 
a command count (used for the number of turns to rest), and takes a full turn.   

<b>Easy rest (TAB) :</b>                                                                
     Actually a macro, this command automatically makes you rest until your HPs  
and mana are restored or you are disturbed.  It is included to cut down on wrist 
stress and allow more effective waiting.                                         

<b>Search (s) :</b>                                                                     
     Search for hidden traps, secret doors, and essences in nearby spaces.  More 
than a single turn of searching will be required in most cases.  This command    
can take a count, which is useful if you are confident of finding something      
eventually, since the command stops as soon as anything is found.  This command  
takes a full turn.                                                               

<b>Toggle sneaking mode (S) / (#) :</b>                                                 
     If you have a stealth skill of at least 10, allows you to start and stop    
sneaking.  See the talent "sneaking" for more details.                           


<H3>Dungeon and Object Alteration Commands</H3>
<b>Tunnel (T) / (Ctrl-T) :</b>                                                          
     Dig through barriers, mine treasure found in wall seams, and otherwise      
alter the dungeon to your liking.  This command may take a count and requires a  
full turn.                                                                       

<b>Open a door or chest (o) :</b>                                                       
     Open a door or chest.  If locked, you will attempt to pick the lock based   
on your disarming ability.  If you open a trapped chest without disarming the    
traps first, they will activate.  Some doors will be jammed shut and may have to 
be bashed open.  This command takes a full turn.                                 
     You may set the "easy_open" option to open doors that you walk into.        

<b>Close a door (c) :</b>                                                               
     Close a door.  Some monsters cannot open doors, so shutting them can be     
quite useful.  If a monster is in the way, you instead attempt to slam the door: 
The monster gets a free turn, then you attempt to close the door.  If you        
succeed, the monster retreats out of the way and loses a turn.                   
     Broken doors cannot be closed.  This command takes a full turn.             

<b>Jam a door (j) / (S) :</b>                                                           
     Jam a door (so that it needs to be bashed down).  Many monsters can simply  
open closed doors, and can eventually get through a locked door.  You may        
therefore occasionally want to jam a door shut with iron spikes.  Each spike     
used on the door will make it harder to bash down the door, up to a limit of     
eight.  This command takes half a turn.                                          

<b>Bash a door (B) / (f) :</b>                                                          
     Bash down jammed doors.  Your door bashing ability increases with strength  
and weight.  Bashing open a door can (briefly) throw you off balance, makes a    
lot of noise, and sometimes ruins the door.  All doors can be bashed; jammed or  
spiked doors will not open any other way.  You may also bash chests.  This       
command takes a full turn.                                                       

<b>Disarm a trap or chest / Desanctify a glyph (D) :</b>                                
     You can attempt to disarm known traps or glyphs on the floor or on chests.  
If you have a disarming skill close to the trap level, disarming by hand will be 
safer than using magic; otherwise, magic is preferable.  If you fail to disarm a 
trap, there is a chance that you will blunder and set it off.  This command      
takes a full turn.                                                               

<b>Alter (+) :</b>                                                                      
     This special command allows the use of a single keypress to select any of   
the dungeon alteration commands above (attack, tunnel, bash, open, disarm,       
close), and, by using macros or keymaps, to combine this keypress with           
directions.                                                                      
     For burglars, it also allows stealing, door-locking, and setting traps.

<b>Browse a book (b) / (P) :</b>                                                        
     Open a readable book and read the spells.  You may select spells by         
pressing their index letter; as you do, extra information appears (unless the    
spell level is greater than your spellcasting skill).  This command takes no     
time.                                                                            

<b>Gain new spells or prayers (G) :</b>                                                 
     When you are able to learn new spells or prayers, the word "Study" will     
appear on the status line at the bottom of the screen.  You then issue this      
command and choose a book with unlearnt magics.  Pious characters get a prayer   
at random; characters of all other realms may choose.  This command takes a full 
turn.

<b>Fuel your lantern/torch (F) :</b>                                                    
     You can refuel lanterns with flasks of oil and torches with other torches.  
In general, two flasks will fully fuel a lantern and two torches will fully fuel 
a torch.  This command takes half a turn.                                        

<b>Light or douse your light source (left-parenthesis) :</b>                            
     Light sources illuminate the nearby dungeon when lit; most also use fuel.   
You can choose between saving fuel or getting light to see.  This command takes  
half a turn.                                                                     

<b>Quaff a potion (q) :</b>

     Read a scroll.  Most scrolls which prompt for more information can be       
aborted (by pressing escape), which will stop reading the scroll before it       
disintegrates.  This command takes a full turn.                                  

<b>Inscribe an object ({) :</b>                                                         
     Inscribe an object.  The inscription appears inside curly braces after the  
object description.  The inscription is limited to the particular object (or     
pile) and is not automatically transferred to all similar objects, unless the    
"Merge Inscriptions when Stacking" option is on.                                 

<b>Uninscribe an object (}) :</b>                                                       
     Remove the inscription on an object.  This command will have no effect on   
inscriptions added by the game itself (such as "{cursed}").

     You have heard rumours of special wearable items deep in the Pits, ones     
that can let you breath fire like a dragon or light rooms with just a thought.   
Should you ever be lucky enough to find such an item, this command will let you  
activate its special power.  This command takes a full turn.                     

<b>Aim a wand (a) / (z) :</b>                                                           
<b>Use a staff (u) / (Z) :</b>

<b>Fire an item (f) / (t) :</b>                                                         
     You may fire ammunition if you are wielding a missile weapon that uses it.  
See the non-magical combat section for more information.  This command takes a   
full turn unless you are using a weapon of extra shots.                          

<b>Throw an item (v) :</b>                                                              
     You may throw any object carried by your character.  See the non-magical    
combat section for more information.  This command takes a full turn.            

<b>Targeting Mode (*) :</b>                                                             
     Aim directly at a specific monster or grid.  See the interfaces section for 
more information.

<b>Help (?) :</b>                                                                       
     Brings up the on-line help system.                                          

<b>Observe an object (I) :</b>                                                          
     Display extra information about a specific object.  If you know nothing     
about the object, you see generic information about the object kind.  If you     
have identified or otherwise know the object, a object description will also     
often appear.  If you have fully *identified* an object, you will recall all the 
special object attributes.  This command takes no time.                          

<b>Character Description (C) :</b>                                                      
     Display extra information about your character.  From this screen, you can  
change names, review attributes, or save your character information ("character  
dumps") to file.                                                                 

<b>Look around (l) / (x) :</b>                                                          
     Look around at nearby monsters (to determine their type, health, and        
carried objects) and objects (to determine their type).  It can also be used to  
find out what objects (if any) are under monsters or traps, what terrain a       
monster is in, and what is under the player.  See the interfaces section for     
more information.  This command takes no time.                                   

<b>Check knowledge (~) :</b>                                                            
     This command allows you to display                                          
  - high scores                                                                  
  - known artifacts                                                              
  - known monsters                                                               
  - monster kill count                                                           
  - known objects                                                                
  - contents of your home                                                        
  - quests.                                                                      

<b>Identify Symbol (/) :</b>                                                            
     Find out what a character represents.  For instance, by pressing "/", then  
".", you will learn that the "." symbol stands for a floor.  If you press        
return, you'll see a list of special uses for this command.                      
     If you ask about a type of monsters, such as 'r' - rodents, and you have    
knowledge of any, the game will offer to show monster recall.  Type 'y' to       
display monsters sorted non-unique then unique, 'l' to list by level, 'k' or 't' 
to list by number of kills, and any other key to cancel.  The list will normally 
start at the monster closest to your current depth.                              
     You may also use this command to ask about all monsters (type Control-A),   
unique monsters (Control-U), non-unique monsters (Control-N), or killed monsters 
(Control-K).                                                                     
     This command takes no time.                                                 

<b>Full screen map (M) :</b>                                                            
     Show a map of the entire dungeon on screen.  Only the major dungeon         
features will be visible because of the scale, so even some important things may 
not show up.  This command is particularly useful in locating where the stairs   
are relative to your current position, or for identifying unexplored areas of    
the dungeon.  This command takes no time.                                        

<b>Locate player on map (L) / (W) :</b>                                                 
     Scroll the map view around, looking at all sectors of the current dungeon   
level, until you press escape, at which point the map will be re-centered on the 
player if necessary.  To scroll the map around, press any of the direction keys. 
The top line will display the sector location, and the offset from your current  
sector.  This command takes no time.                                             
     This command also has another use:  it automatically adjusts the map panel  
to give you a better view in your direction of travel.  If worried about         
offscreen monsters with nasty ranged attacks, this is one way to protect         
yourself.                                                                        

<b>Game Version (V) :</b>                                                               
     Learn what version of the game you are playing.                             


<H3>Message Commands</H3>
<b>Repeat level feeling (Ctrl-F) :</b>                                                  
     Displays your feeling about the dungeon level.  If you are currently on a   
quest, a description of it will also appear.  This command takes no time.        

<b>View previous messages (Ctrl-P) :</b>                                                
     Shows you all the recent messages.  You can scroll through them or exit     
with ESCAPE.  This command takes no time.                                        

Take notes (:) :                                                                 
     Allows you to take notes, which will then appear in your message list       
(prefixed with "Note:").  This command takes no time.                            


<H3>Saving and Exiting Commands</H3>
<b>Save and Quit (Ctrl-X) :</b>                                                         
     Save your character to file and exit the game.                              

<b>Save (Ctrl-S) :</b>                                                                  
     Save the game but don't exit it.  Use this frequently (or turn on the       
autosave option) if you are paranoid about having your computer crash (or your   
power go out) while you are playing.                                             

<b>Save and Quit, or Retire (Q or Ctrl-K) :</b>                                         
     Save your character to file and exit the game.  If you have defeated        
Morgoth, use this command to retire.                                             


<H3>Preferences Commands</H3>
<b>Interact with options (=) :</b>                                                      
     Set and review options.  See the options section for more information.      

<b>Interact with macros (@) :</b>                                                       
     Create, load, and save macros and keymaps.  See the macro and keymaps       
section for more information.                                                    

<b>Interact with visuals (%) :</b>                                                      
     Change, load, and save visual preferences that determine how objects,       
monsters, and dungeon features display.  See the visuals section for more        
information.

     Change the basic colors used by the game.  This command only works on some  
systems.  See the visuals section for more information.                          


<H3>Extra Commands</H3>
<b>Toggle Choice Window (Ctrl-E) :</b>                                                  
     Toggle the display in any sub-windows (if available) that are displaying    
your inventory or equipment.                                                     

<b>Redraw Screen (Ctrl-R) :</b>                                                         
     Update the screen to adapt to various changes in global options, and        
redraws all of the windows.  It is normally only necessary in abnormal           
situations, such as after changing the visual preferences or changing display    
modes.                                                                           

<b>Save screen shot (right-parenthesis) :</b>                                           
     Save a "snap-shot" of the current screen to a file.  You may choose "text"  
(plain text, most suitable for the newsgroup), "forum" (output with vBulletin    
markup codes which can be pasted into posts on the Angband Forum), or "html"     
(for websites and other purposes).  The screenshot will be saved in your user    
directory.                                                                       
     In some ports, you also have the option of taking graphical screenshots by  
typing the Print Screen key.  This has the disadvantage of producing larger      
image files, but the advantage of showing exactly what's on your screen          
(graphics, sub-windows and all) at any moment, even when the game is not         
waiting for a command.                                                           

<b>Repeat last command (Ctrl-V), also (n) / (') :</b>                                   
     Repeat the previous command, selecting the same objects, spells, etc., you  
choose last time.  For example, if you have just Read a Scroll, chose a Scroll   
of Enchant Object, and chose your Longsword as the object to enchant, this       
command will do all these things again with a single keystroke.                  


<b>Special Keys:</b>                                                                    
     Certain special keys may be intercepted by the operating system or the host 
machine, causing unexpected results.  In general, these special keys are control 
keys; often you can disable their special effects.                               

     It is often possible to specify "control-keys" without actually pressing    
the control key, by typing a caret ("^") followed by the key.  This is useful    
for specifying control-key commands that might be caught by the operating        
system.                                                                          

     Pressing backslash ("\") before a command will bypass all keymaps, and the  
next keypress will be interpreted as an underlying command key.  The backslash   
key is useful for creating macro actions which are not affected by any keymap    
definitions that may be in force.  For example, the three-character sequence     
"\.6" will always mean "run east", even if the "." key has been mapped to a      
different underlying command.                                                    

<b>UNIX-specific notes:</b>                                                             
     If you are playing on a UNIX or similar system, then Ctrl-C will interrupt  
the game.  The second and third interrupt will induce a warning bell, and the    
fourth will induce both a warning bell and a special message, since the fifth    
will quit the game, after killing your character.  Also, Ctrl-Z will suspend the 
game, and return you to the original command shell, until you resume the game    
with the "fg" command.  There is now a compilation option to force the game to   
prevent the "double ctrl-z escape death trick".  The Ctrl-\ and Ctrl-D and Ctrl- 
S keys should not be intercepted.

     If you playing on Windows, you may need to turn off num lock in order to    
run.  If you are playing a IBM port under Windows, and see what appear to be     
very strange colors, right-click on the executable, go to "Program Properties -> 
Screen -> Usage, and make sure that the program runs in full-screen mode.

     When you have entered most game interfaces, you can expect common commands

<H3>Objects</H3>
<b>Walking over objects, Picking them up:</b>                                           
     Moving and picking up objects happen in separate turns.  Whenever you walk  
onto objects, you have the option of spending additional time (1/10th turn per   
object) to pick them up.                                                         

     There are three different ways of handling objects you walk on; you choose  
the one you prefer by setting a pair of options.                                 

Maximal information:  Set the option "query_floor" to ON.                        
Minimal distraction:  Set "always_pickup" and "query_floor" to OFF.              
Automatic pickup:  Set "always_pickup" to ON and "query_floor" to OFF.

<H3>Targeting</H3>
<b>The Targeting command:</b>                                                           
     The target command ('*') makes it possible to set up a location or fix a    
monster as the point which you want future missiles and spells to aim for.  Some 
other commands also allow use of the targeting interface (normally by typing     
'*').  However you begin targeting, you have a number of options available to    
you.                                                                             
  ESCAPE)  Exit targeting mode.  Cancel target.                                  
  p)       Return to the player.                                                 
  o)       Start looking at all grids (exact control).                           
  m)       Start looking only at monsters (if any monsters are around).          
  +)       Look at next monster or interesting grid.                             
  -)       Look at previous monster or interesting grid.                         
  r)       (If cursor is on a monster) recall monster information.               
  t)       Target grid or monster.                                               
  Space    See monster's carried objects (if looking)                            
  Return   Continue looking                                                      

     If you have the "use old target by default" option on, be careful about     
clearing targets on the floor when done.                                         

<b>Targeting -- line of fire:</b>                                                       
     Line of fire (LOF) is reflexive:  if you can hit it with bolts or missiles, 
it can hit you -- and vice-versa.  However, you (and your foes) have wider       
fields of view, and can see many things that can't be hit directly.  The monster 
health bar serves as a handy indicator:  When a monster is not in LOF, its       
health bar is bracketed in grey.  If it is in LOF, it will be bracketed in green 
if you can fire upon it directly with arrows or bolts, and white otherwise.      
     If using targeting mode to aim a missile, you are not allowed to select a   
monster not in direct line of fire (although you can target its grid by typing   
'o', then 't').                                                                  

<b>Targeting -- mouse interaction:</b>                                                  
     In some ports, you may use the mouse to make looking around and targetting  
more convenient.  Left double-click engages looking/targetting.  When            
targetting, left double-click sets a target.

<b>Various concepts mentioned below:</b>                                                
  "disturb"    : Cancel any running, resting, or repeated commands               
  "flush"      : Forget any keypresses waiting in the keypress queue, including  
                 any macros in progress                                          
  "fresh"      : Display any pending output on the screen                        

<b>Options you may want to change to your preferences include:</b>                      
- Roguelike commands, if you are used to the commands used in certain other      
  roguelike games.                                                               
- Checking that the hitpoint warning is non-zero can save your character's life. 
- Set the delay factor to two or more if you want to see pretty ball             
  explosions and whatnot.                                                        
- Playing around with the lighting options in the Visual Interface section       
  can be a lot of fun.                                                           

<b>Saving options:</b>                                                                  
     The current options are automatically stored in your savefile when you next 
save the game.  You only need to save options explicitly if you want future      
characters started 'from scratch' (not from a previous character) to use your    
preferred defaults.                                                              
- {savefile name}.prf  : affects only that character                             
- {race name}.prf      : affects all characters of that race                     
- user.prf               : affects all of your future characters                 

     The rules on usage do not fully apply to other kinds of preferences because 
only options are saved in savefiles, but the same file names work the same way   
in all cases.                                                                    


<H3>Birth Options</H3>
     You may only change birth options when starting up a new character.         

<b>Allow specification of minimal stats          [birth_autoroll]  (on) :</b>           
     Allows you to specify minimum stats when creating a character.  Characters  
are randomly generated until one is found to meet your requirements.             

<b>Restrict the use of stairs/recall             [birth_ironman]   (off) :</b>          
     Can never go up.  Can never use recall until you win the game.  No stairs   
are ever placed under you when you change levels.  Adds 40% to score.            

<b>Ironman Play:</b>                                                                    
     "Go down into the dungeon.  Return with Morgoth's Crown or not at all."     
In Ironman mode, you can never go up any staircase, and can never return to the  
surface by any means, until victorious.  If by accident you do, you must         
immediately return to the dungeon.                                               
     Some forms of Ironman play require that you visit no stores before going    
into the dungeon, or that you must use a down staircase as soon as you see it    
("crash-dive ironman"), but they are variants on the basic theme.                

<b>Lock the doors of stores and the home         [birth_no_stores]  (off) :</b>         
     Cannot use any stores or your home.  If you are not playing ironman, adds   
15% to score.                                                                    

<b>Do not create artifacts                       [birth_no_artifacts]  (off) :</b>      
     No artifacts will appear.  Adds 10% to score.                               

<b>No stairs back the way you came               [birth_no_return_stair]  (off) :</b>   
     Never generate a staircase back to the level you came from, even if you     
used a staircase.  If you are not playing ironman, adds 5% to score.             

<b>Monsters exploit players weaknesses           [birth_smart_cheat]  (off) :</b>       
     Allow monsters to know what spell attacks you are resistant to, without     
having to learn them by trial and error, and to use this information to choose   
the best attacks.  Adds 7% to score.                                             


<H3>Option Set #1:  Game Behavior</H3>
<b>Rogue-like commands                           [rogue_like_commands]  (off) :</b>     
     Selects the "roguelike" command set, which uses eight of the letter keys to 
move the character about.  This command set can be really useful if you have no  
number pad, and some people just naturally prefer it.  However, the original     
command set has considerably more unused keys available for macros and keymaps.  

<b>Verify destruction of objects                 [verify_destroy]  (on) :</b>           
     Gives you an "are you sure" message when you try to destroy an object.      

<b>Pick things up by default                     [always_pickup]  (off) :</b>           
<b>Display things before picking them up         [query_floor]  (on) :</b>              
     When "always_pickup" is on, the game assumes you want to pick up any object 
you encounter.  If "query_floor" is off, you pick up objects automatically.      
Otherwise, you are shown a list and prompted to pick up.                         
     When "always_pickup" is off, the game assumes you want to pick things up    
selectively.  If "query_floor" is off, you get a one-line description of the     
object or pile.  If "query_floor" is on, you see a full list, including weights. 
In either case, you can start picking things up by typing "g".                   

     When standing still, you are never charged extra time for picking up        
objects.  When walking, you always take a second partial turn to pick up         
objects; each object picked up takes 1/10th of a turn.                           

<b>Never haggle in stores                        [never_haggle]  (off) :</b>            
     You never haggle in stores, regardless of the markup the shopkeeper asks    
(which is very little or nothing on inexpensive stuff, but can be as great as    
33% on extremely valuable items).                                                

<b>Use old target by default                     [use_old_target]  (off) :</b>          
     Forces all commands which normally ask for a direction to use the current   
target if there is one.  Use of this option can be dangerous if you target       
locations on the ground, unless you clear them when done.                        

<b>Run past stairs                               [run_ignore_stairs]  (on) :</b>        
     Ignore stairs when running.                                                 

<b>Run through open doors                        [run_ignore_doors]  (on) :</b>         
     Ignore open doors when running.                                             

<b>Run past known corners                        [run_cut_corners]  (off) :</b>         
     Cut sharply around known corners when running.  This will result in faster  
running (which matters if you are fleeing), but may cause you to run into a      
lurking monster.                                                                 

<b>Merge inscriptions when stacking              [stack_force_notes]  (on) :</b>        
     Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if one has an empty        
inscription and the other does not.  The resulting stack keeps the non-empty     
inscription.                                                                     

<b>Merge discounts when stacking                 [stack_force_costs]  (off) :</b>       
     Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if they have different     
discounts.  The resulting stack keeps the largest discount.                      

<b>Allow quantity specification                  [allow_quantity]  (on) :</b>           
     Prompt for a quantity when necessary, instead of defaulting to a single     
object.  If you prefer to enter command counts before commands instead of typing 
quantities when prompted, turn this option off.                                  

<b>Change savefile names                         [change_save_names]  (off) :</b>       
     When you start a a new character, a "base name" is created from the full    
name.  It is used for the savefile, character-specific preference files, and     
character dumps.  The base name normally does not change after birth, but if     
this option is on, it will change whenever you rename your character.            
     Traditionally, the Macintosh port allowed base names to change after birth  
and most other ports did not.                                                    

<b>Allow accents in output files                 [xchars_to_file]  (on) :</b>           
     Accents in your character name or other text will be preserved in various   
output files such as character dumps.  They will be saved using your system's    
character encoding.  If this option is off, character dumps will be saved in     
plain ASCII; this is recommended for newsgroup posts.                            


<H3>Option Set #2:  Disturbance and Warning</H3>
<b>Disturb whenever any monster moves            [disturb_move]  (on) :</b>             
     Disturb the player when any visible monster moves, appears, or disappears,  
whether in line of sight or out of it.  This increases safety, but may cause     
trouble when you have telepathy and are trying to rest.                          

<b>Disturb whenever map panel changes            [disturb_panel]  (on) :</b>            
     Disturbs you when the map panel shifts.  This slows down your exploration,  
but makes it easier to avoid leaving a detected area.                            

<b>Disturb whenever player state changes         [disturb_state]  (on) :</b>            
     This option causes you to be disturbed whenever the player state changes,   
including changes in hunger, resistance, confusion, etc.                         

<b>Disturb whenever boring things happen         [disturb_minor]  (on) :</b>            
     This option causes you to be disturbed by various minor things, including   
monsters bashing down doors, beginning to run out of fuel, and changes in the    
weather.                                                                         

<b>Alert user to critical hitpoints              [alert_hitpoint]  (on) :</b>           
     Make a noise and flush all pending input when your hitpoints reach the      
hitpoint warning.  Make certain you also adjust the hitpoint warning.            

<b>Ring bell on error                            [ring_bell]       (on) :</b>           
     Make a bell sound when errors occur (such as typing an invalid key).        

<b>Activate quick messages                       [quick_messages]  (on) :</b>           
     Allows the use of any keypress as a response to the "(+)" prompt, except    
when you are badly wounded.                                                      

<b>Compress messages in savefiles                [compress_messages]  (off) :</b>       
     Compress the savefile, saving only the most recent player messages.  This   
can cut the size of the savefile substantially, but will result in the loss of   
message information.                                                             

<b>Flush input on various failures               [flush_failure]  (on) :</b>            
     This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever various     
failures occur, such as failure to cast a spell, failure to use a wand, etc.     
This is very useful if you use macros, as it will prevent you from walking       
towards monsters when your spells fail.                                          

<b>Flush input whenever disturbed                [flush_disturb]  (on) :</b>            
     This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever the         
character is disturbed.  This is useful if you use macros that take time, since  
it will prevent you from continuing your macro while being attacked by a         
monster.                                                                         

<b>Delay on failure                              [delay_failure]  (on) :</b>            
     The game pauses for a fraction of a second whenever various failures occur, 
such as failure to cast a spell, failure to use a wand, etc.  This helps prevent 
you taking unplanned steps (and thus wasting a turn in the middle of a battle).  

<b>Colored messages when hit hard                [colored_hit_msg]  (on) :</b>          
     The harder you are hit, the more colorful the damage message will be.       

<b>Special colors for hurt character             [colored_hurt_char]  (on) :</b>        
     Your character symbol will change color depending on your health.           


<H3>Option Set #3:  Visual Interface</H3>
<b>Map remembers all seen grids                  [remember_seen_grids]  (on) :</b>      
     Memorize all floor grids that have ever been lit up by you.  This gives     
you a visual record of which areas you have explored on the current level.       

<b>Use special colors for torch-lit grids        [torch_light]  (on) :</b>              
     If the option "floor_lighting" is also on, floor grids that are only lit    
by your own light source or light sources on the floor will appear yellow.  If   
the option "wall_lighting" is on, walls may be colored in the same way (if some  
terrain prefs are tweaked).  Turning this option off will slightly increase the  
speed of the game.                                                               

<b>Use special colors for field of view          [sight_light]  (on) :</b>              
     If the option "floor_lighting" is also on, those floor grids that you can   
see directly appear bright, and all other known grids appear darkened.  If the   
option "wall_lighting" is on, walls will be colored in the same way.  Turning    
this option off will slightly increase the speed of the game.                    

<b>Use special colors for wall grids             [wall_lighting]  (on) :</b>            
     If either the option "torch_light" or "sight_light" is on, wall grids will  
change color depending on lighting conditions.  Turning this option off will     
slightly increase the speed of the game.                                         

<b>Use special colors for floor grids            [floor_lighting]  (on) :</b>           
     If either the option "torch_light" or "sight_light" is on, floor grids      
will change color depending on lighting conditions.  Turning this option off     
will slightly increase the speed of the game.                                    

<b>Highlight the player with the cursor          [highlight_player]  (off) :</b>        
     Place the visible cursor on the player.  This looks fine on terminals, but  
not on most graphical displays.                                                  

<b>Flush output after various things             [fresh_after]  (off) :</b>             
     Flush all output not only after every player command, but also after every  
round of processing monsters and objects, and after every message.  This         
maximizes your information, but may slow down the game (especially on slower     
machines) and on faster machines you cannot see the results anyway.              

<b>Don't hide traps when objects pile on them    [traps_display_on_top]  (on) :</b>     
     Traps display on top of objects, and you need to look at the grid to        
determine if any objects are underneath.  If this option is not selected,        
objects hide traps.                                                              

<b>Show dungeon level in feet (or meters)        [depth_in_feet]  (off) :</b>           
     Display dungeon depths in feet (meters if the "use_metric" option is used)  
instead of levels.                                                               

<b>Show labels in equipment listings             [show_labels]  (on) :</b>              
    Display "labels" (what an object is being used for) for objects in all       
equipment listings.                                                              

<b>Show weights in all object listings           [show_weights]  (on) :</b>             
     Display weights (in pounds or kilograms) of objects in all inventory,       
equipment, store, and home listings.                                             

<b>Show flavors in object descriptions           [show_flavors]  (on) :</b>             
     Display "flavors" (color or variety) in object descriptions and information 
screens, even for objects whose type is known.  This does not affect objects in  
stores.                                                                          

<b>Use Metric (SI) measurements                  [use_metric]  (off) :</b>              
     Display a variety of measurable quantities using metric measurements.       
Conversions are:  3 meters ~ 10 feet, 1.0 kilograms ~ 2.2 pounds.                

<b>Menus pop up when selecting various things    [always_show_list]  (on) :</b>         
     If selecting anything from a list, that list will automatically pop up.     

<b>Move old messages to sub-window automatically [message_to_window]  (off) :</b>       
     If this option is on, and a sub-window is set to display messages, messages 
will be automatically pushed off the main screen to the sub-window, instead of   
manually through keypresses.  However, at present this option will still work if 
the sub-window is closed or moved off-screen, so use with caution!               


<H3>Option Set #4:  Screen Display</H3>
<b>Window Flags:</b>                                                                    
     Some platforms support multiple windows, which can display all sorts of     
useful information.                                                              

  inventory:         Display the character's inventory (and equipment when       
                     requested).                                                 
  equipment:         Display the character's equipment (and inventory when       
                     requested).                                                 
  character screen:  Display the main character screen.                          
  equip attributes:  Display the character screen's equipment attributes         
                     section.                                                    
  visible monsters:  Display visible monsters.  The names of those that have     
                     killed at least one of your ancestors are in red, those     
                     that have never been seen before by this character are in   
                     light blue, uniques are in violet, and other monsters are   
                     in white.                                                   
  nearby objects:    Display objects in line of sight.                           
  messages:          Display recent messages and notes.                          
  overhead view:     Display an overhead view of the dungeon.                    
  monster recall:    Display a description of the target monster.                
  object recall:     Display a description of the most recently selected         
                     object.

Show more things (like text) in tall display:  (off) :                           
     Various interfaces, such as stores, lists, and help, appear in the tall     
(46+ row) display.  This option is most helpful to those with large screens.     

Show the largest map the screen will allow:  (on) :                              
     Maximizes dungeon size at the expense of a slightly less "clean" appearance.

Minimum vertical view distance:    (2) :                                         
     Fully documented on-screen, but note that this allows you to get "center on 
player".                                                                         

Minimum horizontal view distance:  (4) :

<b>Customized left panel rows:</b>                                                      
     Below the monster health bar on the left side of the main screen is empty   
space suitable for displaying information that's important to you.               

  (blank line)   : Useful for spacing out information                            

  Health         : Shows the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. closest monster.  Very useful   
                   to see offscreen breathers!  Uses the same colors and         
                   brackets as the main health bar.                              

  Kill Count     : Number of monsters you've killed                              

  Score          : Current score                                                 

  Fame           : Fame.  Same as that displayed on the character screen         

  Time           : How much time your character has spent alive.  Deliberately   
                   does not show minutes -- the passage of time is "fuzzy".      

  Luck           : How unlucky are you?  Green is normal luck, yellow, orange,   
                   and red indicate trouble.

  Active Target  : Last known direction and distance of your target monster or   
                   location.  Especially helpful if you have the option "use     
                   old target by default" set.                                   

  Realm-Specific : Temporary conditions gained through magic, such as priestly   
                   blessing.  Especially useful for Wizards, Priests and         
                   Necromancers.                                                 

  Attack Modify  : Elemental and vorpal blows, temporary bonuses to shots, hit   
                   and run, etc.                                                 

  Oppositions    : What elements (acid, elec, fire, cold, pois) do you tempor-   
                   arily oppose (over and above any equipment resistances)?      

  Fear/Bold/Hero : Are you afraid, bold (immune to fear), heroic, or berserk?    

  Protection & ..: Are you blessed, shielded, protected from evil, resistant

  Weather        : What is the weather like?  Extremely useful for Druids.       
                   humid:  'D' for dry, 'W' for wet.  Uses the colors yellow ->  
                           brown -> white -> grey -> white -> green -> blue      
                   wind :  'S' for still, 'B' for blowing.  Uses the colors      
                           violet -> blue -> white -> grey, and back again       
                   temp :  'C' for cold, 'H' for hot.  Uses the colors blue ->   
                           white -> grey -> white -> yellow -> orange -> red     

  Noise          : How much noise are you making?  colors are dark grey -> grey  
                   white -> yellow -> orange -> red.  Also notes aggravation.

<H3>Option Set #5:  Difficulty and Assistance</H3>
<b>Allow character to avoid death                [beginner_play]  (off) :</b>           
     You can cheat death.  If you do, your score will be placed in "()"s.  This  
is, in truth, a cheat, but many people find it helpful when first learning the   
game.                                                                            

<b>Know complete monster info                    [cheat_know]  (off) :</b>              
     You can know all about monsters.  Score is reduced by 33%.                  


<H3>Miscellaneous Options</H3>
<b>User Interface:</b>                                                                  
     Some ports of this game allow you to specify various user interface and     
multimedia preferences, such as turning on and off graphics and sound.           

<b>Hitpoint warning:</b>                                                                
     If non-zero, is the percentage of maximal hitpoints (x10) at which you      
start to get special warnings and cannot use most keys to clear messages.  It is 
also used as the cut-off for using red to display both hitpoints and mana, and   
(if the "colored hurt char" option is active) for displaying your character in   
red.                                                                             

<b>Delay Factor:</b>                                                                    
     The "delay_factor" value, if non-zero, will slow down the visual effects    
used for missile, bolt, beam, and ball attacks.  The actual time delay is equal  
to "delay_factor" squared, in milliseconds.  A value of five works well on many  
machines.                                                                        

<b>Autosave:</b>                                                                        
     You may set the game to save your character every so often by using the     
autosave option.  Tweak the timer to control the frequency of autosaves.         


<H3>Options Commands</H3>
<b>Load a user preference file:</b>                                                     
     Reads user preferences (including options) from a file you choose.          
Normally used when preferences don't load automatically, and you want to rewrite 
them to a file that will.                                                        

<b>Save options to a file:</b>                                                          
     Saves options to file.  See the preferences section for help on what        
filename to use (the file "user.prf" usually works).  Because options are        
automatically saved when you save the game, you only have to do this if you want 
to set up a default set of options for multiple adventurers.                     



<H2><A NAME="5.6X">Inscriptions</A></H2><A HREF="manual.html#5.">(return)</A>

     You use the '{' and '}' keys to inscribe and uninscribe objects.  The       
inscription on an object can have all sorts of effects.                          

<b>To designate a main and backup weapon:</b>                                           
     Inscribe both with "@w0".  The 'X' command will replace whatever melee      
weapon you are wielding with another so inscribed.  You may also inscribe these  
or other weapons with "@w1", etc., and wield weapons 0, 1, 2 and so on as        
desired.                                                                         

<b>To have a given command always use the same spellbook:</b>                           
     Inscribe it with "@m#", or "@p#", replacing the '#' with whatever character 
you desire.  This allows you to set up macros to cast a spell knowing that it    
will never choose the wrong book.  Similar inscriptions make archery very        
convenient, and allow you to always use a given magical device with the same     
keystrokes.                                                                      

     In general, if you inscribe anything with @{any command}{any                
character}, you can issue the command, and type the character, to use the first  
legal inscribed object.                                                          

<b>To automatically use a given object with a given command:</b>                        
     Inscribe the object with "@X*", where 'X' is the letter of that command in  
the underlying keyset.                                                           

<b>To prevent accidental use of an object with any command:</b>                         
     Inscribe it with "!x", where 'x' is the letter you type to issue that       
command.  If you are very paranoid, inscribe it with "!*"                        

<b>To learn when an object that recharges automatically is ready for use:</b>           
     Inscribe it with "!!".  This is handy for everything from your Rod of Trap  
Detection to dragon scale mail.                                                  

<b>To automatically pick up an object:</b>                                              
     Inscribe it with "=g".  Especially useful for anything you throw or fire.   

<b>To give a object a special name:</b>                                                 
     A shovel inscribed "#named 'Deepdelver'" will be called "a Shovel named     
'Deepdelver'".  One inscribed "@w0#'Deepdelver'" will be called "a Shovel        
'Deepdelver' {@w0}".  This part of the inscription should always go last.        

<b>Inscriptions for fun and profit:</b>                                                 
     Try inscribing the first monster killed by a weapon, hidden object          
abilities, and where you found the item or who dropped it.                       

<b>Automatic inscriptions:</b>                                                          
     The game also inscribes objects automatically.  Some of these inscriptions  
will disappear when the item is identified, and you may overwrite others.        

  "broken"         :  Object is broken in some way.                              
  "cursed"         :  Object is cursed.                                          
  "empty"          :  Object has no more charges (and you know this).            
  "indestructible" :  Object cannot be destroyed.                                
  "tried"          :  Used an object, didn't learn anything about it.            
  "50% off"        :  Object is worth 50% less than normal.

<H3>Quick Tutorial</H3>
     Necromancers are forever casting spell "a", Magic Bolt, in spellbook "a",   
Beginner's Curses.  In both keysets, that's "maa", plus "." to target the        
nearest monster.  Wouldn't it be nice if you could do all this with a single     
keypress?  You can.                                                              
     Choose an unused command (we shall pick "'" by way of example).  Bring up   
the macro/keymap screen by typing "@".  Press "8" to create a keymap, and the    
game will ask you for a trigger.  Type "'".  You then shift to the action field, 
where you input all the commands you want "'" to perform when pressed.  In this  
case, you would enter:  "maa.", and press return.                                
     Now save your new keymap by typing "6", and either allow the game to choose 
your character's name for the preference file, or (if you want all of your       
characters to use the same keymap) save to "user.prf".                           

     This is only the beginning.  What you can do with a spell, you can do with  
arrows, Rods of Trap Location, resting, activating stuff, talents, searching;    
all sorts of command combinations can profitably be macroed.  Macros and keymaps 
are even more flexible when used in combination with object inscriptions.        
     In all cases, you remember the exact series of keypresses you need to       
issue, pick an unused trigger key, and fill in the action field.                 


<H3>Basic information</H3>
<b>Macros:</b>                                                                          
     Macros allow you to use a single keypress to activate a series of           
keypresses.  They fire off in almost all cases:  when the game is waiting for a  
command, is showing a menu, is asking you to enter text, etc.  The only time     
they don't activate is when you already have a macro active.                     
     You may use any key as a macro trigger, but it is recommended that you not  
use ordinary letters.  You fill out the action field with the same commands you  
normally use.                                                                    

<b>Keymaps  (sometimes known as "command macros"):</b>                                  
     Keymaps only fire off when the game is waiting for a command.  You may not  
use special keys (like F1-F12) as keymap triggers, and must use underlying       
commands in the action field (a list of such commands is supplied below).        

<b>Effects of one on the other:</b>                                                     
     Macros are often affected by keymaps; you may bypass keymaps in macros by   
putting a "\" before any action key.  Keymaps are never affected by macros.      


<H3>Examples</H3>
     Macros are so handy that players (Jim Lyon in particular) have compiled     
lists of helpful tricks.                                                         

<b>To clear any pending messages:</b>                                                   
     Insert some "\e"s (escapes) before and/or after your keymaps and macros.    
Be careful about skipping past important info!  If you want to be a little more  
careful, use "\s"s (spaces) instead.                                             

<b>To learn how to represent any key:</b>                                               
     Some keys cannot be entered simply as numbers or letters.  To figure out    
how to include the escape key in an action, for example, you bring up the        
macro/keymap screen, type 3: Query a macro, and press escape (ESC) when asked    
for a trigger.  This will tell you that an escape is represented by "\e".        

<b>Rest as needed:</b>                                                                  
     Keymap a trigger key to "R*\r".  This is also helpful when waiting for a    
monster to approach, because you recover mana and HPs twice as quickly than when 
staying in place.  Sangband already has a macro of this type, mapped to TAB.     

<b>Fire ammunition from quiver slot 0 (zero) at the closest monster:</b>                
     Macro a trigger key to "f0." ('f', '0', period).  If you get too many       
messages afterwards, you can also add some '\s's.                                

<b>Activate the Phial:</b>                                                              
     Macro a trigger key to "Af\s\s".                                            

<b>Destroy an item or a pile on the floor:</b>                                          
     Macro a trigger key to "099\rk-.y".  This expands to                        
  '0'  - enter a command count.                                                  
  '99' - enter the maximum possible quantity.                                    
  '\r' - press return.                                                           
  'k'  - issue the kill command (in the roguelike keymap, this would be ^D).     
  '-'  - choose the floor.                                                       
  ','  - choose the top floor item (never chooses anything in inventory).        
  'y'  - confirm the kill.                                                       
  '\e' - stop destroying things.                                                 


<H3>In Depth</H3>
<b>Not all keys can be entered as simple numbers or letters:</b>                        
  \e     : escape  (useful for clearing the message line)                        
  \r     : return                                                                
  \n     : newline (is normally treated the same as return)                      
  \s     : space (' ')                                                           
  \\     : backslash  ('\')                                                      
  \^     : caret ('^')                                                           
  ^X     : control-X  (other control keys use the same system)                   
  \x80   : character in position 0x80 (in hex:  decimal equivalent would be 128)

<H3>Adding accents</H3>
     On some systems, you may include accents and special characters in your     
character's name and in various other places by using encodes.  Encodes start    
with an open bracket ( [ ) and end with a close bracket ( ] ).  Between the      
brackets is either a two-character set or a name.  Two character sets always     
specify the accent, then the letter itself.                                      

  `  grave accent      '  acute accent       ^  circumflex       ~  tilde        
  "  umlaut            *  ring (circle)      /  slash (as in o-slash)            

     Therefore, typing ['a] will get you a-acute.                                



<H2><A NAME="5.8X">Preferences</A></H2><A HREF="manual.html#5.">(return)</A>

     Information about options, usage of extra windows, command macros, and      
keymaps can all be stored in preference files.  In addition, you can customize   
the game in many other ways and save these preferences to file.                  


<H3>The priority order of preference files</H3>
     Whenever the game starts up, and whenever it creates or loads a character,  
it opens various preference files and modifies various things according to       
instructions in them.  The preference files below are listed in descending order 
of priority:  anything in higher files overrides anything in a file below it.    

     Be aware that these rules apply only for this variant.                      

"/lib/user/{base name of character}.prf"                                         
     May contain options, color definitions, attr/char remappings (what          
monsters, objects, and features look like), and many other things.  Anything in  
this file is guaranteed to override anything in any other file.                  
     What is the "base name" of your character?  It is the name of your          
character, usually with non-alphabetic, non-numeric characters translated to     
'_'s, and (on IBM/DOS) shortened to eight characters.  You may check the base    
name by trying to save macros or keymaps.                                        

Your character's savefile                                                        
     Always contains your current options and window settings.  Never contains   
macros, keymaps, or visual preferences (these all need to be saved in an         
external file).  Options saved in a savefile will (usually) remain active even   
after the character dies and is reborn.  The major exception is the cheating     
options:  they are reset.                                                        

"/lib/user/human.prf" (replace "human" with your race)                           
     Used to store race-specific preferences.  It is best to edit this file      
after saving it.  Race names are as expected, except that "half-troll" becomes   
"h-troll" on some systems.                                                       

"/lib/user/warrior.prf" (replace "warrior" with your magic realm)                
     Used to store realm-specific preferences; especially valuable for tweaking  
custom side panel rows.  It is best to edit this file after saving it.  Realm    
names are "warrior", "wizard", "priest", "druid", and "necromancer".             

"/lib/user/user.prf"                                                             
     Any preferences that you want to apply to all of your characters should go  
here.                                                                            


     Many players need no other preference files and can stop reading here.      


"lib/pref/user.prf"                                                              
     This file is loaded just before the one above it.  Links to system-specific 
user-preference files, which tend to be used by porters to customize the game in 
ways that they think users of their system will appreciate.                      

"lib/pref/tiles.prf":  The visual preferences file.                              
     Is the gateway to all attr/char remappings and therefore controls what      
everything looks like on screen.  Each of the below files controls game visual   
appearance in a specific display mode; some link to system-specific sub-files.   
     ".../ascii.prf":  Pure ASCII text display mode                              
     ".../font.prf":  Extended text display mode                                 
     ".../chargraf.prf":  Pseudo-graphical font display mode  (not currently     
used)                                                                            
     ".../graf16-g.prf":  Adam Bolt graphics (for everything) display mode       
     ".../graf16-f.prf":  Adam Bolt graphics (plus font) display mode            
     ".../graf32-g.prf":  David Gervais graphics (for everything) display mode   
     ".../graf32-f.prf":  David Gervais graphics (plus font) display mode        

"lib/pref/pref.prf"                                                              
     This is the source of most default settings except for char/attr            
remappings.  It contains the default values of options, the keymaps for the      
original and roguelike keysets, and the default inventory colors.  Links to the  
file "message.prf", which controls the colors of messages.  Links to system-     
specific general preference files (pref-{sys}.prf).  These contain system-       
specific keymappings and allow the game to recognize your keyboard.              

     message.prf:  Message colors.  Each message can be assigned to a type; each 
type may have one or more sounds and a color associated with it.                 


<H3>Writing your own preference files</H3>
     All preference files use a common system to store information.  You must be 
careful of two things:                                                           
1) Make sure that the file will actually be loaded.  It needs to be one of the   
files mentioned above, or be called by one of those files.                       
2) Watch out for automatic preference dumps.  If you try to edit anything        
between the special markers, your changes will be lost.  The solution is to skip 
past all the automatic stuff and put your changes at the bottom, below the last  
marker.                                                                          

<b>List of preference file instructions:</b>                                            

%:user.prf                                                                       
     Open up the file "/pref/user.prf" or "/user/user.prf" and read it.  If both 
files exist, rules in the latter have priority.

     The monster, with index 0 (zero), will be white ('w'), and be represented   
with a '@'.

     The object, with index 50, will be violet ('v'), and be represented with a  
'~'.

     The object, with index 60, will use the graphical tile at row 10, column 14 
(the plus means "add 128 to the number").

     The feature, with index 1 (ordinary floor), will normally be white (color   
1), and be represented by the character in ASCII position 250 (a centered dot).  
Under torchlight, it will glow yellow.  When darkened, it will be slate grey.    

L:247:+2:+15                                                                     
     The flavor, with index 247 (Black Spotted mushroom), will use the graphical 
tile at row 2, column 15.

     The color in position 1 is requested by typing 'w', is called "White", has  
a kvalue of 0, a red value of 255, a green value of 255, a blue value of 255,

<b>Interact with Visuals:  (command: '%') :</b>                                         
     You may adjust the character and attribute (color) used to display objects, 
monsters, and terrain features.                                                  
  1) Update your preferences with a specific user preference file.               
  2) Save your current monster visuals to file.                                  
  3) Save your current object visuals to file.                                   
  4) Save your current terrain visuals to file.                                  
  6) Change monster visuals.                                                     
  7) Change object visuals.                                                      
  8) Change terrain visuals.                                                     
  0) Reset visuals to their last saved values (undo all changes).                

     When changing visuals, you may type the following keys:                     
  n: Advance one (wrap around if at the end)                                     
  N: Go back one (wrap around if at the beginning)                               
 ^n: Jump to a specific item  (the '^' means Control-)                           
  a: Change to the next color (wrap around if at color 15)                       
  A: Change to the previous color (wrap around if at color 0)                    
 ^a: Specify color                                                               
  c: Change to the next character in the ASCII sequence (wrap around if at 255)  
  C: Change to the previous character (wrap around if at 0)                      
 ^c: Specify character                                                           

     A good way to get used to the interface is to choose option 6:  change      
monster visuals, note that the first "monster" is your character, and change it  
from a white '@' to something silly.  Leave, see how weird you look, come back,  
and press '0' to reset the visuals.                                              


<b>Interact with colors:  (command '&') :</b>                                           
     In the interact with colors display, you have three options available:      
  1) Load colors from file.                                                      
  2) Save colors to file.                                                        
  3) Modify colors.                                                              

     In the modify screen, you navigate between colors by typing direction keys. 
When at the color you want to change, you then use the following keys.           
  i: Give the color a unique index character (so it can be requested)            
  n: Give the color a name                                                       
  k: No effect (the game auto-calculates this value)                             
  K: No effect

  B: Decrease the blue in this color (wraps around at 0)                         
  v: Assign the color specific red, green, and blue values.                      

     When making new colors, you should first give the color an index character  
(it must be unique; the game will correct you if you use a character that        
belongs to another color), and then type a name (such as "White").  When you     
have done this, you can then immediately see the color changes you make.         

     Note that color 0 (black) should not be changed.  If your system can only   
display 16 colors, your changes to colors above #15 will not have any effect.    

     After changing colors, you may leave the modify screen for the main colors  
screen, and choose option #3: Save colors to file.  The colors will be saved at  
the end of the file "lib/pref/color.prf", and will take immediate effect.  You   
may then use the new colors for monsters, objects, etc.

     Saving and loading your character should be easy.  So, sadly, is getting    
him killed.  Winning is a little harder, but the novice player can get special   
assistance to improve his chances down in the dungeon.                           


<H3>Saving your Game</H3>
     Saving your game is usually easy.  You can use the save game command, or    
(on some systems) a menu option.  If you cannot save your game, you probably     
have one of two problems:                                                        
1) The folder "{game}/lib/save" does not exist.  Create this directory and       
   any others that are missing (see the list of files elsewhere in the docs).    
2) You are using a multi-user machine and do not have write permission to        
   that file or directory.                                                       


<H3>Loading your Game</H3>
   The game can load savefiles using several methods.  In order, it:             
1) Loads any file that you specify with the "-u" command line option.  This      
   only applies to some ports.                                                   
2) Loads the first file specified in "save/global.svg", but only if that         
   character is alive.                                                           
3) Loads any file named "PLAYER" (capitalization may or may not be ignored).     
4) Shows you a savefile management screen, allowing you to choose files          
   listed in "global.svg", type in another filename, or start a new character.   

<b>Location of the savefile directory:</b>                                              
- On single-user systems, it is {game directory}/lib/save/.                      
- On multi-user systems, it is within a game-created folder in your user         
directory.                                                                       

<b>Dead characters:</b>                                                                 
     If you load a dead character, the game will flash a message telling you     
that it is using the slain adventurer's monster memory.  You then create a new   
character.                                                                       

<b>Savefile compatibility report:</b>                                                   
     Sangband loads files from Sangband 0.9.9 and later.                         


<H3>Winning The Game</H3>
     Victory is slaying Morgoth, Lord of Darkness, before he or any of his       
minions slay you.  He rules his empire far deep in the Pits, at 5000 feet, one   
hundred levels below the sunlit surface.  Barring your way to him at 4950' is    
Sauron, creator of the One Ring, whose power bears comparison with Morgoth       
himself.                                                                         

     Vanishingly few adventurers ever return to the surface with the Iron Crown  
of Morgoth, wrath-blackened cage of the Silmarils.  Few ever wield the Hammer of 
the Underworld, that dreadful maul which pulps an Ancient Dragon in a blow.      
People have played this game for a decade and more without a single victory.  If 
you win -- are victorious without cheat, assistance, or subterfuge -- tell the   
tale on the forum to those who have yet to taste that triumph!                   


<H3>Upon Death and Dying</H3>
     If your character's hit points fall below zero, he dies.  The dreaded       
tombstone will appear, and you may check out his attributes and possessions one  
last time.                                                                       

     Your character will leave behind a reduced save file, which contains only   
the monster memory and your option choices, both of which new characters may     
use.  It is very helpful to know something about the monster that slew your      
ancestor!                                                                        


<H3>Cheating Death</H3>
     One of the most important things about this game is that your character's   
life is so important.  Let him die, and you start over from scratch.  This is    
one of the secrets to this game's fascination; anyone who cheats death is really 
not getting the full experience, and any Morgoth-slayers yanked from the jaws of 
death are not full winners.  But what if your characters seem to die all the     
time (like mine!), and you really want to keep playing with the same guy?  Well, 
the game has a few answers for that too.                                         

     You may cheat death by toggling on the "cheat death" option.  This keeps    
your character ticking, and you get a running tally of your deaths on the        
character screen.  Trying to keep this number low is a great way to learn the    
game.

<H3>The History of Sangband</H3>
     Skills Angband, or Sangband for short, is the oldest variant of Angband     
still active; many long-time players remember it with great fondness.  It was    
among the first roguelikes anywhere to introduce skills, shapechanges, fully-    
fledged natural and necromantic realms, and special character talents.  Whole    
webpages have been devoted to its features, and many a game developer has been   
influenced by them.                                                              

     Sangband grew out of Chris Petit's interest in developing a version of      
Angband with a skills system rather than character classes.  It was first        
released March the 3rd, 1994, using the Angband 2.5.x codebase as modified in    
Bangband (another of his variants).  When Chris Petit graduated, development     
stopped for about a year at version 0.8.5 (released April 29th, 1994).           
     After that, Michael Gorse took over the project, re-releasing version       
0.8.5, then taking the game up to 0.9.3 between 1995 and 1997.                   
     Julian Lighton happened to stumble across Sangband, and (aided by Greg      
Wooledge) found himself fixing bugs as he found them.  First he made them        
available on a website, then decided he had too much free time and took over     
Sangband officially, releasing 0.9.4 in 1997 and 0.9.5 in 1998.  His work sorted 
out the major game bugs and updated the code to Angband 2.8.3.                   
     In 2001, he passed the maintainership to Leon Marrick, who had played       
Sangband almost since the beginning (first bug report in '95) and modeled parts  
of his own variant on it.   Scott Yost released beta 15, making a number of      
helpful changes and bug fixes.

<H3>The History of Angband</H3>
This file was last updated for Angband 3.0.1.                                    

Make sure to read the Forum ("http://angband.oook.cz/forum/") for the most       
up to date information about Angband.                                            

Angband has an incredibly complex history, and is the result of a lot of work by 
a lot of people, all of whom have contributed their time and energy for free,    
rewarded only by the pleasure of keeping alive one of the best freeware games    
available anywhere.                                                              

The version control files, if they existed, would span more than ten years time, 
and more than six different primary developers.  Without such files, we must     
rely on simpler methods, such as change logs, source file diffs, and word of     
mouth.  Some of this information is summarized in this file.

<b>Brief Version History:</b>                                                           

First came "VMS Moria", by Robert Alan Koeneke (1985).                           

Then came "Umoria" (UNIX Moria), by James E. Wilson (1989).                      

Details about the history of the various flavors of "moria", the direct ancestor 
to Angband, can be found elsewhere, and a note from Robert Alan Koeneke is       
included in this file.  Note that "moria" has been ported to a variety of        
platforms, and has its own newsgroup, and its own fans.                          

In 1990, Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand, with the help of other students at the    
University of Warwick, created Angband 1.0, based on the existing code for       
Umoria 5.2.1.  They wanted to expand the game, keeping or even strengthening the 
grounding in Tolkien lore, while adding more monsters and items, including       
unique monsters and artifact items, plus activation, pseudo-sensing, level       
feelings, and special dungeon rooms.                                             

Over time, Sean Marsh, Geoff Hill, Charles Teague, and others worked on the      
source, releasing a copy known as "Angband 2.4.frog_knows" at some point, which  
ran only on Unix systems, but which was ported by various people to various      
other systems.  One of the most significant ports was the "PC Angband 1.4" port, 
for old DOS machines, which added color and various other significant changes,   
only some of which ever made it back into the official source.                   

Then Charles Swiger (cs4w+@andrew.cmu.edu) took over, sometime in late 1993,     
cleaning up the code, fixing a lot of bugs, and bringing together various        
patches from various people, resulting in several versions of Angband, starting  
with Angband 2.5.1 (?), and leading up to the release of Angband 2.6.1 (and      
Angband 2.6.2) in late 1994.  Some of the changes during this period were based  
on suggestions from the "net", and from various related games, including "UMoria 
5.5", "PC Angband 1.4", and "FAngband".                                          

Angband 2.6.1 was primarily targetted towards Unix/NeXT machines, and it         
required the use of the low level "curses" commands for all screen manipulation  
and keypress interaction.  Each release had to be ported from scratch to any new 
platforms, normally by creating visual display code that acted as a "curses"     
emulator.  One such port was "Macintosh Angband 2.6.1", by Keith Randall, which  
added support for color, and which formed the basis for the first release of     
Angband 2.7.0.                                                                   

In late 1994, Charles Swiger announced that he was starting a real job and would 
no longer be able to be the Angband maintainer.  This induced some amount of     
uproar in the Angband community (as represented by the Angband newsgroup), with  
various people attempting to form "committees" to take over the maintenance of   
Angband.  Since committees have never given us anything but trouble (think       
"COBOL"), there was very little resistance when, on the first day of 1995, Ben   
Harrison made his code available, calling it "Angband 2.7.0", and by default,    
taking over as the new maintainer of Angband.                                    

Between then and 1999, Ben Harrison transformed Angband, becoming (in many       
people's minds) the most important contributor to the game since Robert Koeneke. 
The first and most important change he made was a massive code-level cleanup.    
This, combined with the development of a generic, OS-independant interface,      
allowed simple porting to many new and existing platforms (including X11, IBM    
machines, OS2, Windows, Amiga, and Linux), and made possible the explosion of    
variants that adds such vigor to the game today.                                 

  Major changes made in this period include:                                     
- macros and keymaps                                                             
- user preference files                                                          
- user-customizable template files for monsters, objects, ego-items,             
  artifacts, vaults, and terrain features.                                       
- more powerful and efficient line of sight, lighting, grid refresh,             
  and spell projection code                                                      
- better string-handling                                                         
- new or rewritten inventory and equipment management, monster processing,       
  object creation and effects, and a whole lot more.                             

After the release of Angband 2.8.3 Ben's free time was more and more occupied by 
his work.  He released a beta version of Angband 2.8.5, introducing many new     
features, but couldn't give as much attention to maintaining the game as he      
wanted to.                                                                       

So in March 2000, Robert Ruehlmann offered to take over Angband and started to   
fix the remaining bugs in the Angband 2.8.5 beta.  The resulting version was to  
be released as Angband 2.9.0.  Further bugfixes and a couple of new features -   
including many in the realms of user-customizability, with greater control over  
ego-items, player races and classes, monsters, items and artifacts - have led to 
the current version.

rec.games.roguelike.angband,rec.games.roguelike.moria Subject: Early history of  
Moria Date: Wed, 21 Feb 1996 04:20:51 GMT                                        

I had some email show up asking about the origin of Moria, and its relation to   
Rogue.  So I thought I would just post some text on the early days of Moria.     

First of all, yes, I really am the Robert Koeneke who wrote the first Moria.  I  
had a lot of mail accussing me of pulling their leg and such.  I just recently   
connected to Internet (yes, I work for a company in the dark ages where Internet 
is concerned) and was real surprised to find Moria in the news groups...         
Angband was an even bigger surprise, since I have never seen it.  I probably     
spoke to its originator though...  I have given permission to lots of people     
through the years to enhance, modify, or whatever as long as they freely         
distributed the results.  I have always been a proponent of sharing games, not   
selling them.                                                                    

Anyway...                                                                        

Around 1980 or 81 I was enrolled in engineering courses at the University of     
Oklahoma.  The engineering lab ran on a PDP 1170 under an early version of UNIX. 
I was always good at computers, so it was natural for me to get to know the      
system administrators.  They invited me one night to stay and play some games,   
an early startrek game, The Colossal Cave Adventure (later just 'Adventure'),    
and late one night, a new dungeon game called 'Rogue'.                           

So yes, I was exposed to Rogue before Moria was even a gleam in my eye.  In      
fact, Rogue was directly responsible for millions of hours of play time wasted   
on Moria and its descendents...                                                  

Soon after playing Rogue (and man, was I HOOKED), I got a job in a different     
department as a student assistant in computers.  I worked on one of the early    
VAX 11/780's running VMS, and no games were available for it at that time.  The  
engineering lab got a real geek of an administrator who thought the only purpose 
of a computer was WORK! Imagine...  Soooo, no more games, and no more rogue!     

This was intolerable!  So I decided to write my own rogue game, Moria Beta 1.0.  
I had three languages available on my VMS system.  Fortran IV, PASCAL V1.?, and  
BASIC.  Since most of the game was string manipulation, I wrote the first        
attempt at Moria in VMS BASIC, and it looked a LOT like Rogue, at least what I   
could remember of it.  Then I began getting ideas of how to improve it, how it   
should work differently, and I pretty much didn't touch it for about a year.     

Around 1983, two things happened that caused Moria to be born in its             
recognizable form.  I was engaged to be married, and the only cure for THAT is   
to work so hard you can't think about it; and I was enrolled for fall to take an 
operating systems class in PASCAL.                                               

So, I investigated the new version of VMS PASCAL and found out it had a new      
feature.  Variable length strings!  Wow...                                       

That summer I finished Moria 1.0 in VMS PASCAL.  I learned more about data       
structures, optimization, and just plain programming that summer then in all of  
my years in school.  I soon drew a crowd of devoted Moria players...  All at OU. 

I asked Jimmey Todd, a good friend of mine, to write a better character          
generator for the game, and so the skills and history were born.  Jimmey helped  
out on many of the functions in the game as well.  This would have been about    
Moria 2.0                                                                        

In the following two years, I listened a lot to my players and kept making       
enhancements to the game to fix problems, to challenge them, and to keep them    
going.  If anyone managed to win, I immediately found out how, and 'enhanced'    
the game to make it harder.  I once vowed it was 'unbeatable', and a week later  
a friend of mine beat it!  His character, 'Iggy', was placed into the game as    
'The Evil Iggy', and immortalized...  And of course, I went in and plugged up    
the trick he used to win...                                                      

Around 1985 I started sending out source to other universities.  Just before a   
OU / Texas football clash, I was asked to send a copy to the Univeristy of       
Texas...  I couldn't resist...  I modified it so that the begger on the town     
level was 'An OU football fan' and they moved at maximum rate.  They also        
multiplied at maximum rate...  So the first step you took and woke one up, it    
crossed the floor increasing to hundreds of them and pounded you into            
oblivion...  I soon received a call and provided instructions on how to 'de-     
enhance' the game!                                                               

Around 1986 - 87 I released Moria 4.7, my last official release.  I was working  
on a Moria 5.0 when I left OU to go to work for American Airlines (and yes, I    
still work there).  Moria 5.0 was a complete rewrite, and contained many neat    
enhancements, features, you name it.  It had water, streams, lakes, pools, with  
water monsters.  It had 'mysterious orbs' which could be carried like torches    
for light but also gave off magical aura's (like protection from fire, or        
aggrivate monster...).  It had new weapons and treasures...  I left it with the  
student assistants at OU to be finished, but I guess it soon died on the vine.   
As far as I know, that source was lost...                                        

I gave permission to anyone who asked to work on the game.  Several people asked 
if they could convert it to 'C', and I said fine as long as a complete credit    
history was maintained, and that it could NEVER be sold, only given.  So I guess 
one or more of them succeeded in their efforts to rewrite it in 'C'.             

I have since received thousands of letters from all over the world from players  
telling about their exploits, and from administrators cursing the day I was      
born...  I received mail from behind the iron curtain (while it was still        
standing) talking about the game on VAX's (which supposedly couldn't be there    
due to export laws).  I used to have a map with pins for every letter I          
received, but I gave up on that!                                                 

I am very happy to learn my creation keeps on going...  I plan to download it    
and Angband and play them...  Maybe something has been added that will surprise  
me!  That would be nice...  I never got to play Moria and be surprised...

<b>Posted by Geoff Hill on the Angband newsgroup on 2004-10-31:</b>                     

Well, Alex and Andy are the true fathers of Angband. And probably                
Andy most of all. He's a talented coder, and I *think* (I could ask              
him, perhaps!) that Angband was partly driven by him looking for a               
challenge. By this, that he found Nethack a little easy, so wanted a             
beefed up hack type variant, and (U)Moria seemed a good base.                    

And he (and I to a lesser intent) were heavily involved in Warwick LP            
Mud and it was a creative time in the games world - the internet was             
still fairly fresh - we were using the Joint Academic Network (JANET)            
and it is a wonder that anyone ever completed their education!                   

Andy, to the best of my knowledge, has not ever completed Angband,               
although I have heard he has been playing Z (its been a while since I            
asked).                                                                          

When Andy and Alex graduated it was left playable and about 2/3 of the           
release it became. Sean and I picked it up from then. I think Sean               
was more of a driving force, because he wanted to move it forward to             
release. In my case I was just keen to tinker the game balance (I was            
the completion specialist, I guess) and add and amend some things.               

So we added about 1/3 of the artifacts, monsters, vault types. Added             
high resists (up until then we only had the elements). Added new                 
breathe types. Tweaked game balance. Tweaked player races and added              
race special abilities. The most time consuming part was rewriting (or           
in some cases writing from scratch) the monster descriptions. It took            
me forever! And it is difficult to be creative at 4am after a night              
in the bar. Qllqllzuup is witness to that (drunk when that one was               
done!).                                                                          

Some of the artifacts from that time are remarkably untested at                  
release. I still think of that '1/3' as being 'new' ones and not the             
true artifacts, I guess because I had a hand in writing them. So,                
ones like Deathwreaker, Tulkas, Bladeturner etc are relatively untried           
before release.                                                                  

One area that Sean and I had a difference in opinion was in the                  
'Tolkien' element. I felt that it should stay more true to the                   
Angband theme, and he was less bothered about that. I disagreed with             
him putting in Gabriel, Azriel etc as frankly I felt they had no part            
in a Tolkien based world. But, no matter, Azriel has made a point of             
killing me ever since to put me straight ;-).                                    

Sean and I released it to the wider world (with the help of Charles              
Teague? I am not sure when he became involved, I would perhaps have to           
ask Sean for more background asI am still in touch with him). Charles            
may have become involved after release, or before, I am not certain.             

At that point it was only set up to make on a SunOS system, so I                 
suspect that many people who are better coders than me then went mad             
converting it to their own systems.                                              

I suppose if one wanted to tweak the background paragraph with any of            
the above, you could, but it is largely correct as it stands. Perhaps            
for completness at Sean and I's involvement it could say                         

'Sean Marsh and Geoff Hill took Angband over when Alex and Andy                  
graduated from the University of Warwick. They updated Angband with              
some much needed depth, and worked remotely with Charles Teague to               
release it to the community. ' and then as before about frog-knows.              
Charles was not at the Uni, of course. I forget his location, as we              
only ever emailed him.                                                           
The existing paragraph somewhat suggests that Sean and I released a              
'copy' known as frog-knows. I suppose in some respects it was the                
first variant of Angband but as it was the only version release it               
became vanilla?                                                                  
If so, that is ironic really, given comments earlier in this thread...
